"JUST BUY IT LOL! It took a little over a month to receive it and I did grow impatient, but it was well worth the wait. I ordered a size 7 and it was a perfect fit, Amy was so attentive and responded within minutes! I tried to get a good picture to show how beautiful it is!! Pictures don‚Äôt do justice, thank you Amy!
"
"The ring did take a little longer to complete and get to me, but seller was very responsive. Seller made sure I received exactly what I ordered and this ring is beyond beautiful! This is my engagement ring üíç . I wasn‚Äôt allowed to submit multiple photos so I‚Äôm showing a photo of how the ring looks at night üíó
"
"(Writing this on my future husband's account) This ring is absolutely stunning. We are at the beach and it just sparkles like nothing I've seen before. I cried when I saw it in person. Amy did a great job helping us with what we needed, and we will definitely be coming back for a wedding band!
"
"Amy was so easy to work with, and such a big help throughout the entire process! My fianc√© loves her ring! It is beautiful and shines so brightly. Photos do not do it justice whatsoever! Production of the ring took approximately 6 weeks and shipping to Tennessee took approximately 4 days. Also, our dog chewed up the ring box the night of our engagement. Amy is kind enough to send another one so we can have the keepsake. Do not hesitate to order her products!
"
"I absolutely love this ring! Its so pretty and I‚Äôve gotten so many compliments. It hasn‚Äôt turned my finger green yet, I AM STOKED!!
"
"Such a dainty ring! I‚Äôm obsessed!!!!

"Love this sweet little ring so much, it‚Äôs so dainty and feminine! Fast shipping as well!
"
"I love my ring! It‚Äôs exactly what I wanted so perfect!
"
"Just got my ring. It‚Äôs so beautiful! So glad I finally pulled the trigger after more than a year of ogling. It honestly looks even better on my finger than the pictures. Very happy.
"
"Such a beautiful ring!!! I am so obsessed, I keep bragging about it to everyone! Lol the band is so dainty it makes the stone pop even more and I LOVE IT
"
"I am so in LOVE with this ring. I bought it as my class ring and the emerald went great with my university colors. It was shipped so quickly and I recieved it within three days. Definitely recommend!! (:
"
"This ring met my expectations and arrived on time. The band is dainty but seems sturdy. The color of the stone is gorgeous. I‚Äôm very pleased and have already looked at ordering a sapphire ring too.
"
"My ring is absolutely perfect! Shipping was a slow due to Covid-19, but it finally came in and I am so pleased with it. It‚Äôs perfectly dainty and elegant as my wedding band.
"
"WOW ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• Elle remplace mon alliance de mariage original et sinc√®rement, j'aurais d√ª choisir celle-ci comme bague de mariage d√®s le d√©part! hihi Honn√™tement, j'ai h√©sit√© √† acheter cette bague √† cause de la couleur affich√©e en photo : j'avais peur qu'elle soit plut√¥t ""or terreux"" tirant vers le cuivr√©... pas du tout! Elle est d'un beau gold brillant et classique, pas trop jaune non plus. Mon mari l'a aim√© d√®s qu'il l'a vue! Les d√©tails sont magnifiques. Elle n'accroche pas. Elle se porte magnifiquement avec tout. La preuve qu'il n'y pas que les diamants qui font briller une femme ;) Si l'attente de quelques semaines/mois ne vous d√©range pas, n'h√©sitez pas! C'est un petit chef d'oeuvre artisanal et le prix et plus que raisonnable... Un v√©ritable coup de c≈ìur dans mes achats cette ann√©e! ‚ô•‚ô• Merci beaucoup Silvergrams! Bon travail!
"
"This ring is completely beautiful! The order did take a few months to get here due to covid 19 which is understandable but the wait was definitely worth it. The seller Rod was very responsive and did an awesome job answering all my questions(: I will be buying more from this shop in the future!
"
"I LOVE THIS RING. I‚Äôve had it in my cart for a while and finally made the purchase. Zero regrets. It is a dainty ring but that is as described and I prefer this style. I love it so much I purchased a second in silver.
"
"This ring is absolutely gorgeous. It looks very realistic and as if it really hosts an actual diamond. I placed my order on February 24th and received the ring on March 23rd. Definitely worth the wait! My fianc√© and I are so happy and I simply adore this beautiful ring. Thank you, Ted and Mag!
"
"I am *beyond* happy with the ring. It arrived *super* fast, *very* beautifully packaged, and with a small note as well!! The ring itself is just *beautiful*, I cannot express how much I *love* it. The cz is very brilliant, looks just like a real diamond!! And the *detail* just. wow. Wow. Each tiny little flower is just *perfect*. I've gotten TONS of compliments on it!! I'll be coming back around Christmas to order the solid gold one, it's that beautiful!!

Thank you so much Ted&Mag!!
"
"Arriced quickly once shipped! Had to be patient though for it to ship. I ordered a size 5 based on OTHER sizings I've done and it's a tad big, so I recommend you use whatever the seller is recommending to get your size. I personally didnt even check the sellers recommendation so that is on me. Ring has pretty star details holding the cz up. Brilliantly sparkles in the sun. Has a good weight to it. The ring is taller than I expected but I'm not complaining! It feels beautiful. Packaging was also very cute and made the arrival that much more special and sweet.
"
"took nearly a month to come in, but it is absolutely stunning! I‚Äôm obsessed with it and cannot stop staring at it! thank you!
"
"Love it, love it, love it. The ring is beautifully made and has a unique artisan flair. The stone is exactly as pictured in photo. Shipping was very, very fast from Israel. Will purchase more from this artist!
"
"Absolutely perfect. It took me awhile to open the package wanting to have my daughter present when I did so, she really wanted the ring that was stolen. Both of us love this ring. She was particularly enchanted with the scroll work on the band as am I. You have made my transition from a stolen favorite ring to this new favorite ring very easy. Thank you for the ease of communication and the prompt delivery. Working hands in the picture!
"
"Mara knows how to make a precious gem glow and shine.
I think I‚Äôm becoming a Marajoyce addict for her artistry with precious metals and gems.
A stunning creation.
"
"What a stunner! This is the best opal I have ever seen. Good communication as well as I had a few questions regarding ring sizing and care- Mara always replied quickly. Thanks so much, I will enjoy this ring for a long time.
"
"I love this ring so much! It has my baby's fingerprint - he died just after birth and I didn't have many prints. I sent the best one in (though it still wasn't great), and am so glad the ring shows the few distinct lines the print had.
"
"I‚Äôm honestly in love‚ù§Ô∏è my ring is absolutely stunning. The details are amazing! My order came in about 2 weeks after placing. The packaging was beautiful. The care instructions are simple. I spent hours deciding which shop to go through to keep a part of my father with me all the time. I definitely recommend her. Thank you so much ‚ù§Ô∏è
"
"Saying I love my ring does not cover how much happiness this brought me! So dainty and stacks beautifully. The attention to detail in my furbaby's paw print is breathtaking, beyond what I imagined! Thank you so much! I will definitely be shopping here for any personalized jewelry!!
"
"I am so happy with my ring. It is in memory of my son and helps me feel like a tiny part of him is with me. Thank you for making such a special product!
"
"I ordered 2 rings, this one and a herkimer diamond ring. Love them!  Don‚Äôt ask me which is my favorite because that would be impossible to decide.
These are such pretty rings, made with skill. They fit perfectly! 
No doubt I‚Äôll me ordering more from BlueSoulDesigns. Arrived quickly in a pretty gift box and packaged well.
"
"So beautifully made. It looks so much more substantial than so many other wire-wrapped rings. Lovely piece. Very happy.
"
"Love üíï this ring so much! It‚Äôs so unique and borderline dainty. I just love it! I
"
"I absolutely LOVE this ring!  It is dainty yet substantial enough.  Would highly recommend this ring & this seller!
"
"Such a beautiful, light, airy ring.  My son is so excited that I have a ring that reminds me of him.  I love the silver with the peridot, and couldn't be happier with this purchase.
"
"The ring with a peridot is beautifully made. It is one of my favorite rings and fits perfect with my other peridot jewelry. The contact with the seller was very nice. A recommendable shop.
"
"This ring is beautiful, unique and comfortable. I was impressed with the artist willingness to work with me to make it large enough for a thumb ring.  She made it specifically for me and was able to still send it to me in a timely matter. I'm super impressed and plan to purchase more from this artist!
"
"This ring is soooo BEAUTIFUL!  I ABSOLUTELY LOVE IT!  Thank you so much for being so talented! !
"
"I wear this ring daily!  It is so dainty and pretty, but the rose gold coloring has faded overtime around outside of ring band from washing hand - is now silver but still pretty.
"
"Such a pretty ring sparkles like crazy! Just hope the rose gold doesn't wear off quick because it is so pretty
"
"This ring is just as gorgeous as my first ring I bought! Insanely fast shipping and it arrives in an adorable box, perfect for gifting!
"
"This ring is very pretty and elegant. I will probably wear it as a right-hand ring, or as a stand-in for my engagement ring when I travel. It feels well-made and sturdy but looks dainty and delicate. Love it!
"
"I love this so much! I had a little hiccup with the shipping but everything was resolved with ease! I was going to say I‚Äôll be back for more but I literally just already placed another order 5 minutes ago as my 4th piece from Nicole! üíú
"
"My ring finally came in ! It took a little longer than expected, but it‚Äôs beautiful! I was a little scared to spend so much considering the amount of fake moldavite going around, but this is a real moldavite ! You have to buy it to see for your self! I did reach out because of the time expectancy but the service was impeccable! Will be buying again, sooner than later!
"
"REAL Moldavite for sure!  I can feel the stone's energy.  I am super happy with the ring I received.  I did get a ""coffin"" shaped ring at first, but returned it for a non-coffin shaped ring.  Easy returns/exchanges.  The owner is on top of things - great communication, prices, and shipping was super fast.  Thanks!!  I will be back
"
"I have been following this shop for years and finally treated myself to a ring. I thought that would satisfy my love for this art, but now I cant wait to buy more. This jewelry is gorgeous and unique there is so much love that goes into each piece
"
"An absolutely beautiful engagement ring. My partner adores it. The diamond catches the light beautifully and it‚Äôs all round a gorgeous ring.
"
"Love love love love love. The top photo shows the contrast in direct sunlight, and the bottom is inside. Depending on the lighting the grey will be more pronounced. (The colors seen in the bottom photo are from a stained glass window reflecting nearby!) I absolutely love this ring and am so glad we chose to order from Lena. She answered any and every question I had and the ring took only 3 days to arrive once shipped. After spending weeks looking for a salt and pepper diamond, I was thrilled to come across this listing. If you are even considering a salt and pepper diamond, do not hesitate to inquire about this beauty!
"
"So this is my second engagement ring, we got it to match my fianc√©‚Äôs wedding band since his is grey/black with black diamonds + rose gold trim. It‚Äôs so beautiful in person and people love it! 
I put a photo of the 2 ct. salt and pepper ring with rose gold alongside my original ring (not from etsy) which is a .65 center white diamond for comparison. My ring size is a 3.5. The seller was very nice and sent me a video and photo of the diamond she would use.
"
"I can‚Äôt stop staring at my new engagement ring! Honestly it‚Äôs one of the prettiest rings I‚Äôve ever seen. My fianc√© is very proud of it and I‚Äôm a very happy fianc√©e. He says his favorite part is how much I love it. Lena was amazing and patient answering all our questions about fitting it with wedding bands we had from my grandma. She even gave us a little sneak video to help with our excitement (though to be honest it was all my excitement)!  Shipping was incredibly fast! I hear nothing but compliments when people notice my ring!
"
"Hab das erste mal √ºber Etsy bestellt und bin sehr √ºberrascht. Den Kontakt zu Anna Lena direkt ist super.
Und ich bin so zufrieden ein wundersch√∂ner Ring so schnell geliefert supersch√∂n mit Liebe verpackt. Nette Worte geschrieben eine h√ºbsche kleine Karte dabei. Toll Danke Anna Lena auch meine Tochter war sehr begeistert.
"
"It pleases my wife. The elvish-like band combined with the moonstone. She's loving the style. It arrived very fast. Thanks again.
"
"There was a lot of back and forth with my Post Office and I let Annalea know what was going on. She stuck by me, every day and then I finally got my ring. Her work is way beyond compare...and she's a great person to match. I'm only buying from her from now on. Thanks Annalea.
"
"I love the ring! It also got a little history to it. The carriers destroyed the package the first time, but you sent a new one, and I did not have to pay anything extra. 2-3 months later, I got a beautiful ring! 
Thank you so much!
"
"Was originally sent the wrong ring, contacted the shop and they sent me the correct ring. Once I received this ring, I fell in love! It‚Äôs a lot more prettier in person than the photo. The picture does not do it justice!
"
"LOVE this ring.  This ring is beautiful and much more well made than I was expecting.  The band is rounded- not hammered flat which gives it a sturdy well made feel, and the stone is gorgeous.  I love the copper mixed in with the turquoise.  The stone isnt flat into the setting, it's sort of rounded over, but feels secure and doesnt feel like its going to come out or stick so far out that I catch it on everything.  I'm in love with this ring!
"
"I got this ring as a replacement for a turquoise ring I had lost. I had trouble finding one similar and wasn't thrilled by the ones I was seeing. I chose this one based on size and color. I was happier than expected when I received the ring. It fit perfectly and was unique in design. I get compliments all the time. Thank you!
"
"Such a cute ring!! Quality is good, and the stone is so pretty. Size 8 was slightly larger than I expected it to be? But nothing bad to say about the ring üòä
"
"This is a beautiful ring and the price is amazing! It‚Äôs very sturdy and the band is nice and thick. I‚Äôm in love with it. Sizing was accurate. Shipping was shockingly fast. I would absolutely recommend this ring.
"
"Very pretty ring!  A little smaller than I thought and it seems to run small. Usually a size ten fits slightly loose on my right hand and perfect on the left but it is too tight on my left. 
Got it sooner than expected, yay!! I figured it would take a long time coming from Turkey.
"
"I bought this ring for my birthday. It is regal!  I will say that it was not altogether pristine when it arrived. I had to pick out residue from the side intricate design. Then, dipped it is silver cleaner. DON‚ÄôT do that because the gold vermeil will be permanently removed. (Update- the gold has come back and it is beautiful!!!) I am so pleased with my purchase! Check out my pics. It is all silver now. I wonder what the stone actually are because, I can imagine this ring costing what it cost with true sapphires and topaz. But, still its a gorgeous ring!
"
"This ring is the most beautiful of rings in craftsmanship I've seen! Gorgeous beyond words! So much detail and love for art was spent into the making of it. Sparkly! The picture really doesnt give it justice, it is a must have! Even personalized with my first name initial! So excited to wear on a daily bases!  Packaging was compact and perfect! Especially having traveled so far. I absolutely feel in love with it! I look forward to more business with this vendor! Astonishing work! Thank you so much! Extremely satisfied!
"
"Thank you Mary! And Koten Studios! I ordered this back drop necklace in silver and it is absolutely stunning! I will be wearing it New Year's Eve with a V backed black dress for a Phantom of the Opera theme.  Perfect! And on top of that, I requested matching earrings which were made just for me and they came today. Wow! Very fast on the shipping! If you are thinking of purchasing anything from this amazing artist,  do it.  You will not be disappointed!  If I could fill in more stars, I would!

"Wore these 1 day, and had so many compliments on them. Love these!
"
"Incredibly sexy and gorgeous. It is delicate and I keep worrying I‚Äôm going to break it but I love it.
"
"Very Happy<3 <3 <3 <3
"
"The ring looks lovely.
But I never received it. 
Tracking shows it has been sitting in another state here in the U.S for a month.
Etsy has refunded me.
*Update 060121
I did receive my ring. It is lovely. The mail is just taking a lot longer than seems right
I am very happy with my purchase and I let Etsy know I received it.  It is a lovely ring and the artist is very talented.
"
"Absolutely stunning!!!
"
"This jewelry is beautifully made. Takes a little while to reach U.S but worth the wait. I have several beautiful pieces.
"
"Buena calidad, muy bonito y comunicaci√≥n f√°cil con el vendedor. Un diez.
"
"this is such a beautiful ring, i absolutely love the way it fits & how detailed the flower is. i‚Äôm a size 9 & i order a 9 1/4 US & it fits perfectly!!
"
"I love my ring! I just had a baby and got his birth flower! It‚Äôs so cute and special. I kinda wish I had gotten the big oval (my bad) but the small one is dainty and adorable too. I may order another with the big oval too
"
"Cute! Looks exactly like the picture. I like that there are different size ovals available with actual length measurements attached. It helped me pick the perfect size (small oval) for my index finger. I also love how flush it lays to the skin. This is one ring I know won‚Äôt snag on cloths or blankets!
"
"I‚Äôm in love with this ring! I wear it every day. It‚Äôs so beautiful and really great quality. It arrived on time and looks even better than the pictures.
"
"This ring is absolutely beautiful I can‚Äôt wait to see what good comes from this stone as well thank you
"
"The ring is absolutely gorgeous. Zero regrets on my end and would definitely recommend to others.
"
"super pretty, I'm obsessed with it

"Absolutely gorgeous!! looks just like the picture!
"
"Gift for a friend and she loved it!
"
"This ring is absolutely beautiful, but my camera is not picking that up.  Anyway, just gorgeous!!  My 7th ring purchased from Fayana, love her work!
"
"Ganz schnelle Lieferung nach Deutschland, super Kontakt zur Verk√§uferin, sie ist so lieb und war stets erreichbar und hielt Kontakt zum Kunden.
Ware ist super, ich liebe meinen Ring sehr ‚ù§ Danke liebe Fayana ‚ô°
"
"So happy with this ring! I bought it for myself as a birthday gift and am so glad that I did! It's dainty and beautiful!
"
"Just a lovely ring. Surpassed my expectations. Simple, but elegant. An easy ring to wear every day. Highly recommend!
"
"My spouse and I were looking for new wedding bands. But, we wanted something simple and that had meaning because our daughter's birthstone is blue topaz. These are BEAUTIFUL. The color of the topaz is gorgeous and feels secure in its setting. In addition, the store owner is super nice and communication is VERY quick. Would definitely buy from this store again!

"
"Thank you, Ani! My sister loves the Lapis Lazuli ring üíô
"
"I love this ring! I got a labradorite Stone, not the moonstone in the store‚Äôs photo. The stone is beautiful and natural looking. The setting is very plain, which I love, smooth and elegant. The ring is accurately sized.
"
"Love my ring! Got a free gift too, which was a wonderful surprise!! Packaging was cute! Delivery took a few weeks, but considering where it was shipped from and being notified ahead of time, it was worth the wait!! Would definitely order from again! Thank you so much!
"
"Beautiful!!!! Love the ring and get many compliments on it. Had to ask for tracking information and took forever to receive but definitely pleased with my ring!
"
"I LOVE this ring! It's gorgeous - the flowers inside look beautiful. Thank you!
"
"Got these as part of my gifts for my bridesmaids to wear with their dresses. Loved them. Exactly what I wanted! They loved them too!
"
"These small flowers were so pretty and arrived in time.
"
"So so pretty! I love how dainty the flowers are‚Äîthey're small and subtle, which I LOVE the look of. 100% recommend! <3
"
"Beautiful craftsmanship!  Thank you for great purchasing experience!
"
"I have several of Galyna's rings. They are all so beautiful and beautifully made.  I also now have a really pretty pair of her earrings.  I can't say enough how happy I am with my purchases.
"
"The ring is stunning and the care taken to package it came straight from the heart. Thank you!!
"
"These are spectacular I love love love them high quality and colors are vibrant and I‚Äôm always surprised with her quality and colors are so beautiful‚Äîalso they are not too heavy for my ears and I‚Äôm older and my ears pull down and these work!  Durability appears to be there as well‚ÄîI just received all of her earrings so hoping they will last and I‚Äôm very careful with these kinds of earrings‚Äîso very happy with purchase always and ordered three more because these are my outfits working on zoom all the time!
"
"Absolutely love this ring! I bought it to replace one I had lost recently and I couldn‚Äôt be happier with how it turned out. It fits perfectly and the amber is beautiful. I would order more rings from here in a heart beat. Well worth the money (:
"
"This beautiful little ring has exceeded my expectations. Nice quality and fast shipping too.  Doesn't get better than this.  Thank you!
"
"Easy & enjoyable communication, simple payment option, fast delivery (the envelope itself is a treasure), and an absolutely gorgeous ring!!  Couldn‚Äôt be happier üòÜ Thank you so much!!!
"
"Received my ring today, 12/27/2016 and I absolutely love it.
it makes a wonderful every day ring because of the size of the setting and sits low on the hand. I recommend it to anyone that loves handcrafted jewelry from Israel.
"
"Beautiful ring! Looks just like I expected, very delicate with lots of sparkle. Size is great and the stone is cut beautifully. Madelynn shipped the ring to my parents' address so that I could collect it at Christmas -- it was my engagement ring. It arrived right on time and I got to show my entire family. Would definitely buy more of this beautiful jewelry.
"
"Very beautiful!! It‚Äôs my wedding ring and I couldn‚Äôt be happier with it. Fast, easy & satisfying service. Thank you!!
"
"This looks a-mazing. It is so much more beautiful in person. I used it as an engagement ring and my fiance is absolutely thrilled! Thank you so much. Fantastic!
"
"I have wanted this ring for years, but could never afford it. When I found it at such a good price, I about lost it I was so excited! Since I got it I have been showing it off to everyone and we all love it!
"
"This ring is absolutely GORGEOUS! Took less than 2 weeks to receive which is great because My fianc√© and I are on a time crunch for our wedding. We decided we were going to look at rings together and I stumbled across this one and there were so many good reviews and comments about all the different rings that I knew I wouldn't be disappointed. It took a little longer to ship because (shows in the description) I wear a 4.75 in ring size so they had to make it smaller. We Ordered the 14k White Gold Moissanite Ring, it fits perfectly and it shines so beautifully! I am so obsessed! My Future Hubby loves it too! Thank you so much!! We will be buying a wedding band soon from Zhedora! <3
"
"Received this today and I am absolutely in love with it! I looked for literally 2 years and this was worth the wait! Tons of compliments already! And I can‚Äôt stop looking at it! With a family we couldn‚Äôt stand the thought of spending a fortune on a real diamond that would‚Äôve been so small anyways! This is more beautiful than any diamond! We opted for the 18k white gold & generic moissanite! It‚Äôs brilliant! The customer  service was amazing! We‚Äôll definitely be back to this shop!
"
"First of all, 10/10 for customer service!! This took 2 long months to get to me, because the first set was lost in the mail. Zhedora made me a  new set and sent it to me via FedEx express instead of USPS and it was much quicker but then it got stuck at customs... but zhedora was in communication with me the whole time and made sure I received the rings. 

Second of all, the ring is PERFECT. I was nervous after waiting so long that I wouldn't love it, but it exceeded my expectations. It's so light and comfortable, and the moissanite sparkles like crazy!! I'm a size 5.5 for reference. Thank you Zhedora I am very happy!
"
"Beyond happy!! Decided to get the forever one moissanite with the lifetime warranty. I have a size 6.5 finger and it's the perfect size without it being too flashy. Its sparkles like crazy and i can't stop looking at it!!
"
"I love this ring! I have a large ring finger/size and it‚Äôs so nice this shop offers larger sized rings, my ring is so beautiful and shipped so fast, thank you, I love it!!
"
"Love everything about my ring. Shipped on time and the ring itself is very good quality. Fit to size and it is not bending like a cheap ring would. It reminds me of Pandora quality rings. I‚Äôve recommended it to many people and will continue to!
"
"This ring has already gone through so much and still looks brand new! LOVE it so much! Highly recommend the finish that isn‚Äôt ‚Äúshiny‚Äù. If you scratch it, you can‚Äôt tell!
"
"The ring shipped on time and I love it!! It fits perfectly. The font is really cute. I got the gold color. So far, the color is still intact and I've had it for a couple months now. I'm in love with it. I would totally recommend this to everyone!!
"
"This ring is beautiful. We chose it as a unique engagement ring made with his birthstone. The alexandrite is slightly larger looking on my finger than I thought it would be, and I'm not complaining! I love the way it changes depending on the light. Every time I look at it, it's different from the time before :) Scott answered any questions I had promptly and shipped so fast! Thanks again!!
"
"Thank you so much for the gorgeous ring ü§ó! I have had my eye on it for a while now and I finally talked myself into a treat, and what a treat it is! I love it and it is a perfect fit, I will definitely buy from this shop again!!
"
"I absolutely love this ring! I've gotten so many compliments on it. I love the way it changes color depending on the lighting. At times is a crystal blue, sometimes it's a purple, and I've even seen pink! The ring that was sent to me was actually bigger than what I ordered, but the seller was very accommodating and resized it for me. He refunded my shipping fees for sending it back and returned it to me in just a few days. He even made me a wedding bands to match. I'd definitely do business with them again.
"
"üíúLove this ring! Photo doesn‚Äôt do it justice but I was thrilled enough to try.
"
"Sehr netter Kontakt! Versand super und auch der Ring ist perfekt! Danke!
"
"LOVE this purchase! The wait was long but worth it, and it actually arrived early within the stated shipping window. The size is exactly as-ordered. One of my stones is a little darker than was pictured, but well within the bounds of expected variation. I am super happy with the purchase and would definitely recommend this shop.
"
"I am absolutely in love with the setting and diamond on the ring! 
However, the ring is a bit too big, I had requested a 5.5 and it fits more like a 6. Also, I had requested an image of the ring before it was shipped and never received one, which turned out ok, as I love the ring.
"
"Wundersch√∂ner Ring!
"
"Love Love my ring. It‚Äôs absolutely beautiful! It‚Äôs hard for me to find rings for my little fingers. This one fits perfect. Thank you.
"
"Love my new ring. It‚Äôs so beautiful and I get a lot of complements!  Thank you!
"
"Very fast shipping and the ring is lovely! The seller is very accommodating (we weren't sure if the size would be right and the seller offered plenty of time to do an exchange for a different size, if needed). I would definitely buy from this seller again!
"
"I am absolutely in love with this piece. It is stunning! I will definitely be ordering from this shop again. Thank you sooo much !!
"
"I just love this ring! My beloved boyfriend gifted it to me with the earrings in the same style and I couldn't be happier! Thank you!
"
"This is such a cute concept executed beautifully into a delicate ring! The sparkles are not as obvious as the photo but it's still such a cute piece.
"
"This ring feels good on your finger. It is light and easy to wear. When the sun catches it, it glitters. I can tell that the ring is really well made, and it makes me want to shop from this creator/owner again. I wish the stone were a little larger--so that the stars could be seen even more so, but there is a larger one that people can purchase, too.
"
"this is the most beautiful ring i have ever had in my life. thank you sooo much!! :)
"
"Super cute. I wanted something that was both minimal but also eye catching and this is definitely it.
"
"This ring is SO GORGEOUS!!! I absolutely love it! ü•∞ It's a definite steal for the price! The quality and craftsmanship is so elegant and suitable for everyday wear. The crystal is beautiful quality. I am so happy to have this ring in my collection!! üòç The seller is super sweet and attentive. She got my order ready and shipped within hours. Ten stars!!! ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê
"
"I love this ring. It‚Äôs so dainty. Looks much better in person, the pictures don‚Äôt show much of the sparkle.
"

"
"Literally one of my fav rings. Doesn‚Äôt turn your finger green thank god ‚ú® well made super cute!!
"
"The item is just as described. My photo does not make justice but I wanted to share it. I was so delighted with this product that I bought another item from this seller. The silver does look like real silver. The stone is not as bright as it looks, but still is really colorfully recommended.
"
"The quality of this ring is fantastic.  Solid silver, weighty and gorgeous. I love it!  Just got it and cannot take it off.  Can't wait to order again from this store.
"
"Beautiful ring! Center stone is even bigger then expected and very brilliant! I also was able to customize the width of the band which was super nice! Making my ring more dainty! I purchased this ring to use in place of my engagement ring when I wear gold jewelry! Definitely would recommend!
"
"I cannot describe how much I LOVE my ring. The seller was extremely patient with my anxious messages about the ring. I am completely satisfied with my item and the entire process of receiving my ring.
"
"amazing customer service. soni had convinced my bff to go with moissanet, and she did. but she needed a size 11. when it came in it was a bit damaged but the seller immediately sent a replacement. lost story short she ended up using her old ring and I kept this one as an upgrade. the ring is beautiful, really. I fell in love with it. seller didn't hesitate. I was so worried bc it came from overseas but nope.. all is well. thanks again. I will def buy again in the near future.
"

"
"This ring is absolutely everything I was hoping for! It‚Äôs GORGEOUS!!
"
"The ring is so beautiful I'm in love
"
"Absolutely stunning piece of jewelry!  This ring exceeded my expectations and I will definitely be looking to order more from this shop.
"
"I absolutely love this ring! In normal light it looks like a pearl with a slight glimmer, and in the sun it looks multicoloured, shimmering all different colours. So beautiful! Had many compliments, and the band itself is made so well. Thank you!
"
"Beautiful ring! Bought the ring and loved it so much that I bought another one for my mum too! We now have matching ones and the packaging it came in was so sweet. We both love them. Arrived in a short time. Very much recommend if you're looking for a small but very pretty ring! The opal really catches the light as well.
"
"The fit was absolutely perfect and there is no way a photograph can do justice to how lovely and delicate this ring is. Better than I could have wished for!
"
"Absolutely love this product! 

My ring size wasn‚Äôt listed but when I
contacted Kat she was able to help me right away. 

The ring fits perfectly and is beautiful! Very happy!
"
"Oh my, I could wax lyrical about this beautiful ring all day -I just adore it! Seller was really helpful, fast delivery and the quality and overall look are just amazing. I've got my eye on the silver version now!!!
"
"Fab communication from seller from the outset and when the ring arrived in good time for Christmas it was even more beautiful than I hoped for. My friend absolutely loved it as did I - thinking of treating myself now! Will definitely buy from Calico Rose Studio again! Great value for money too!
"
"Incredibly well made and really unique looking ring. Because it's ordered based on size it fits perfectly. It came in a beautiful hand crafted pouch as well with a sweet personalised message. Communication was great as well, timely and really I have no complaints whatsoever. I will definitely buy more in the near future. Thank you!!!!!
"
"LOVE LOVE LOVE. Sapphire is my birthstone and that's what initially drew me to this ring. After receiving it I was delighted. It was perfect, unique, and you can tell it was crafted with care. It came with it's own little pouch and Hazel included some literature about care instructions and some fun facts about sapphires as well. Hazel was wonderful to work with and I received the ring rather quickly since it was shipped from the UK to the US. I will be purchasing more from her studio for myself, family and friends in the future.
"
"This ring is beautiful, and Alya was a pleasure to work with! The ring is dainty and well-crafted-- well worth the wait for shipping from Turkey! It looks as beautiful as in the picture, and the stone takes on different colors in different lights. I love it! Thank you :)
"
"It‚Äôs literally the cutest most dainty little right and I smile every time I look at it. Super worth the buy. I really love it ‚ù§Ô∏è
"
"Beautiful! I love this little citrine. It's so dainty and sweet, and perfect for everyday use. The band is super thin but feels very strong.
"
"It arrived today! I couldn't be happier. Yes, it took 2 1/2 weeks, but next time I'll pay the extra for express! So happy! Thank you.
"
"Obsessed!
"
"Amazing shop, shipping was so quick. The ring is precious, so we'll made and polished to perfection. With sizing it's a bit smaller than I hoped since they don't do half sizes so I can't stack it like I hoped but it's gorgeous as a little dainty ring on its own.
"
"Absolutely love!
"
"Loving this new ring! Bought it as a gift for myself for making a commitment to a happier and healthier life. Thank you, thatblinglife, for helping me to symbolize!
"
"I'm in love with my new ring. It's a bit dainty but I love it. I've been in choir for six years so it really suits me
"
"Absolutely adore my ring, can't wait to make another purchase!
"
"Muy elaborado, sencillo y elegante
"
"This ring came in time and looks great but I wore it for one day and it started bending.
"
"I love!!! Its exactly what I wanted, I was scared the 7.5 would be too small, and it fits a little looser than my other rings fit, but I love it!
"
"Ring is gorgeous!!!!!  Beautifully wired wrapped tigers eye crystal.  Affordable and beautiful.  Not too small just perfect.  I am definitely buying from this seller again.  I want one in every type of crystal.  Worth the buy!!!
"
"I love it! My hands were shaking trying to open it( I love tigers eye) Ring is Beautiful and fits like a glove. Tigers eye is bright and clean. Thank you!!
"
"Absolutely beautiful, good size stone wrapped nicely in wire-cool! Fits perfectly and is replacing my 25 yr old tigers eye ring band that broke when I grabbed a door handle too tightly. I was devastated but I‚Äôm glad I was able to find this one. I‚Äôve every intention of coming back to this store & looking at more items. I will be a repeat customer. And I do recommend this store.
"
"I love this ring and get tons of compliments on it, but just be aware that the rose gold finish wears off very quickly. Still a beautiful ring.
"
"I love it, it's so cute.
"
"Love this ring! Fits perfectly and I have gotten many compliments on it already
"
"I‚Äôve been showering with my ring and wearing it to the beach all summer and it‚Äôs only just now starting to fade a bit, but no tarnishing! It‚Äôs a really pretty dainty ring that holds up much better than I‚Äôd expect gold plated to. Would recommend!
"
"It is perfect and really elegant.
"
"Absolutely fabulous workmanship. We get compliments from guest all the time.
"
"This clock is beautiful!   And is a perfect addition to my mid century modern decor!  It looks just like it was made with brass...  your honestly hard pressed to know it is wood from a distance until you get up close!  It is however pretty delicate so be careful unpacking...
"
"So elegant and beautiful!! It's light and silent, and I love the movement of the second hand. I'd recommend ordering a few different colour second hands to change the look with season or theme.
"
"BEAUTIFUL & UNIQUE RING!!! LOVE IT !!!
Service and Communication is Outstanding
Shipping was fast and it arrived so bountifully rapt
"
"No ven√≠a el peque√±o diamante en el anillo , era s√≥lo la flourita de color verde y no como La foto , pero debo decir que el anillo esta espectacular , y barato para el precio.
"
"Love this ring! Super fast shipping and great customer service.
"
 
"My wife loves the ring, the seller answered all my questions and shipping was fast. My wife loves the ring so much she that she had this to say ""This ring is even more beautiful in person. Delicate and small, it perfectly compliments smaller hands. Chalcedony is my favorite gem and the artist took care to select a subtle green shade with hints of blue. The band is very thin and rounded with a hammered texture - I found this to be super comfortable as I don't even feel this ring when I'm wearing it. Seller was very responsive and accommodating to my husband who placed the order as a Valentine's Day gift for me. I also love that all materials are responsibly sourced and affordable. We will definitely buy from this shop again!""
"
"I found out shortly before a trip out of state that my partner was potentially going to propose to me while on our trip. I wanted her to have a little something in return, to make her feel as special as I knew I would. I knew the turn around time would be very short, if even possible to fulfill in time.  I received this beautiful little ring a couple of days before our trip, and was able to pull off a pretty great surprise! 
Thank you so much for your quick turn around!!!  I know that can be a big ask.
"
"Obsessed!! It's even prettier than I expected! Thank you, Allison!
"
"This ring is a little treasure. It is romantic, delicate, and yet a little bohemian (to me at least). I love it and I am wearing it everyday. PraxisJewelry also included a note with simple instructions on how to take care of it and clean it. There was a little problem with the delivery that Allison solved in no time. She replied right away to my messages and find a solution with no hesitation. I would definitely buy from her again (in fact, you know, I have spotted this pink sapphire ring that looks so, so pretty and I might just...)
"
"I purchased this ring about a year ago! I absolutely LOVE it. The stone is my birth month, so when i lost my ring at the beach! I had to repurchase it! It's such a cute and classy ring!!!
"
"I ordered this ring in sterling silver. I absolutely love it! The opal catches the light beautifully & is just the right size for my finger. It came very quickly. Thanks Angie!! :)
"
"It‚Äôs so beautiful! I love everything about it ‚ù§Ô∏è
"
"I really love this ring.  It looks my size 8 chubby finger look delicate and beautiful!
"
"Love, love, LOVE this ring! Stephanie was awesome to work with - the quality (in both the metalwork and gem) is top rate. I would highly recommend any of her pieces. Will definitely be back for more as the occasions present themselves!!!
"
"Absolutely beautiful ring and fantastic customer service. The craftsmanship of the ring is solid and the stone shimmers beautifully in the light. I love the handmade look and style of the rings from Metalicious. I usually don‚Äôt wear much jewelry but decided to get this ring to celebrate my 10 year anniversary with my spouse. When I first ordered the ring I was unsure about my ring size (tried measuring my finger with a string) and ended up ordering it too large. Stephanie replied quickly to my messages and was very understanding and accommodating in helping me find my correct size. The turnaround time for my refitted ring was very fast and I‚Äôm very happy with the results. Thank you again Stephanie for all your hard work :)
"
"Beyond beautiful ring!! The craftsmanship and customer service are amazing, and the ring is more beautiful in person than it was in the pictures. I can‚Äôt wait to propose with it!!
"
"Super perfect for me! Took me forever to find one that spoke to me!, but this is it! Thank you!!
"
"This ring is beautiful in person and just what I was looking for. I receive compliments on it each time I wear it. Will be purchasing from this shop again! Thank you!!
"
"It took a while to receive (from purchase to delivery receipt), but the worksmanship cannot be denied!  The picture for the listing pales in comparison with how it looks in reality. The moissanite is truly near colorless (off white) as specified (this has not been my experience with more expensive purchases).  Besides color, the cut and clarity are off the charts beautiful.  I will definitely be purchasing from Golden Bird Jewellery again when looking for exceptional quality!  Thank you!
"
 
"Oh my gosh! My ring is absolutely gorgeous! You will not be disappointed! It was a little big but I'm just going to get it resized. I chose rose gold for my metal. Pictures do not do it justice. It sparkles like crazy. From the day I ordered to the day I received my ring it took 1 month. The owner answered all of my questions promptly and had the CAD design and video to show me before I bought it. I will definitely be buying here again. Thank you so much!
"
"I am obsessedddddd. 
My boyfriend & I have been talking about our future for awhile & I told him I wanted to something handcrafted & supported a small business. 
One night we landed on Scott‚Äôs page, saw the reviews & did the damn thing.
Although we aren‚Äôt engaged yet, my boyfriend LOVES the ring & I snuck a peak as well & it‚Äôs perfect. Can‚Äôt wait for the next few weeks when I get to have it & show it off to everyone. 
Thank you, Scott! Can‚Äôt wait to order my wedding band too.
"
"All I can say is WOW! This ring is stunning. I asked Scott if he could send me a photo of the stones and he sent a video. This helped me decide what style to go with. Shipping was fast. Packaging was thoughtful. This ring is absolutely beautiful and this will not be my last order!
"
"I couldn‚Äòt believe my eyes when I first opened the box. The ring is beyond beautiful and way more than I expected. It‚Äôs just perfect in each way. I live in germany and waited one week and only a few days for the delivery. Scott, thank you so so much ! Will definitely order again. Wish you the best!
"
"Upon first getting my ring, I was not 100% happy with the setting. It was too flat to my finger and it just wasn't right for me. (On someone else's hand, I'm sure it is lovely.) So, after talking to Scott (who gets gold stars all around for his customer service and responsiveness!) I felt much better about my purchase. We agreed on a custom order and I LOVE my new setting! It's just what I wanted. Super fast shipping both times, too!
"
"I loooove this ring! It came way sooner than promised! It was packaged cute! And it's absolutely gorgeous! My only complaint is that I don't have pretty hands, but that's not the vendor's issue, lol. I did blur my hand in the pic, but I didn't alter the image of the ring in anyway. I highly recommend this seller & will definitely be shopping here a lot more! Thanks so much!!!üíñ
"
"Received my ring this morning and I absolutely love it! I‚Äôm in the UK so my order took just under 4 weeks to arrive which was the stated time frame, so I‚Äôm very pleased it arrived so quickly! The ring is beautiful and fits perfectly (I‚Äôm a size 52 or size L so went for a a US size 6). The stone is a gorgeous colour and well cut and came in a gift box which was lovely. Highly recommend this item and seller.
"
"This ring is trully very beautiful and one of a kind I'm in love and it's the 2nd ring I've purchased from this shop! The color is beyond lovely, you won't regret buying from this shop, the quality of the rings is excellent and it's also very affordable!! I wouldn't find another ring like this anywhere else and especially not for the price! Shipping was also quicker than I expected! If I could give it more stars I would! Perfect!
"
"Omg !!!! I just absolutely love this ring . I am beyond happy . Thank you so much üíïüíïüíï
"
"Beautiful ring but upon further inspection the little ""claws"" that hold the opal are not like shown in the pictures. They more pointy and not very even (one sits higher than the stone, not making contact). I'm worried those pointy bits will snag on blankets or clothes. I decided to buy this ring specifically because those claws were pictured as smooth & rounded over. I'm disappointed because this is going to be a gift for my girlfriend and now I'm worried it will have issues.

EDIT: It is snagging on everything and now I have to take it somewhere to fix the issue. Quite disappointed
"
"The ring is a dream! ü•∞  the quality is very high. It fits perfekt and the diamonds are sparkling. Its 14k solid gold.
Couldn't be happier! 
It fits allone or with my promisses-ring.
The delivery fast fast and the communication with the seller was very friendly. 
 
I will give 1000 stars* and would order again! I'm in love and admire it all the time! Thank you! üòç
"
"Absolutely love this ring! I had it custom made in 18k white gold. The seller was quick to respond and adjust to my request. Thank you very much! I will be wearing it permanently üòä
"
"I bought this ring for my best friend and she loved it! :) Thank you so much for designing a beautiful ring! The only thing I would have liked is a certificate of authenticity included with the ring but it‚Äôs still a gorgeous piece.
"
"This is definitely the best mood ring I‚Äôve ever bought or have ever seen! I absolutely love it! Great work! I absolutely adore it! I love mood jewelry! I always have! I wear another mood ring everyday that I also bought from this shop as well! If you want mood jewelry this is definitely the shop to go to. I know what your thinking...a little pricey. But it‚Äôs worth it. And no one is telling me to say this or put this. I honestly can say I‚Äôve bought at least two rings now from this shop and she does a phenomenal job! 100% I am happy with this! I always have gotten compliments on my other ring that she made! I‚Äôm so happy I finally ordered this one too! Definitely will me ordering more soon! Thanks again! ‚ô•Ô∏è
"
"HOO BOY I adore this ring! Totally getting my Vada Sultenfuss (My Girl) vibes on with this ring. Thank you! It's GORGEOUS!
"
"I love this ring! Most mood rings I've owned over the years rarely change from blue, green, or purple. When Kristina, the seller, says she uses a special stone I believe her because I have seen this ring turn so many different colors I've never seen another mood ring capable of like orange, pink, yellow, and turquoise. Since I don't wear a lot of jewelry I also really love the simple setting, and even though this ring is quite large it is very light and doesn't weigh my finger down. I have had my eye on this ring for about a year and I'm so happy I finally made the purchase. Not only is the ring amazing, but it shipped fast and was considerately packaged. I can't recommend this seller enough. If you're looking for mood jewelry then this is the only shop you need on etsy.
"
"Wow! It just doesn't get better than Kristina's!! She is an amazing jeweler who you can tell is passionate about making quality mood stone jewelry! 
I love everything about it!  I use to get so many compliments on my color changing nail polish but not anymore. This ring is so eye catching with such brilliant colors. Most people first question is ""where did you get that?!"" To which I respond Everise and Kristina on Etsy!! I've had many mood rings and there is no comparison when it comes to the quality of Kristina's work. The color, shine and quality is unmatched.
"
"This is my second purchase from Anemone. The settings on the two rings Ive bought are very unique, which I love. This stone is milky white in normal lighting but in the sun you can really see the almost galaxy-like hints of blue in the moonstone. Its beautiful.
"
"It is the most beautiful ring ever... I‚Äôm so in love with it ‚ù§Ô∏èü•∞ Thank You ‚ò∫Ô∏è
"
"I like this ring. It is a lot bigger than I expected however. It sits really high off my finger. Now that I‚Äôm used to it I love it!
"
"I'm in love with these rings. Perfectly perfect
"
"This ring is stunning! The stone is beautiful, and I think the setting is really nicely done. The band is a little bit big on me but I can get that fixed. Shipping was surprisingly fast too!
"
"My ring is more beautiful than the photo and Masha is a great communicator and a lovely person. Due to COVID-19 my package took 2 months to arrive but Masha kept me posted. Time was all worth it thanks to her wonderful jewellery and customer service. Will return for sure! Xx
"
"Such a beautiful ring! I've gotten a lot of compliments on it. Shipping was as stated, If not a few days sooner, considering it shipped from Israel to the United States.
"
"LOVE IT!!! Fits perfectly!!! Absolutely beautiful!!
"
"This ring is gorgeous!  It looked pretty in the picture, but it honestly looks way better on my finger and it only took 10 days to get it!  I will definitely be purchasing more from you!
"
"My husband bought me this ring for Christmas and it's BEAUTIFUL! The color is gorgeous and really makes a statement.
"
"I absolutely love this ring. Great quality for the price.
"
"Bought this ring for my girlfriend and she loved it!

Was made custom fit - which was perfectly done - and looks/feels exactly how advertised in the photos. The customer service was also excellent. I would highly recommend this ring/CarrieStudios.
"
"I wear it every day. Thankfully I read the reviews and ordered a size down (I'm usually a 7 and I ordered a 6) and it fits perfectly!
"
"I love my ring, I gave it 5 stars because it is PERFECT!! I will be buying another ring from this shop today!
"
"My ring got to me super quickly and it is so beautiful! I definitely recommend!
"
"Turquoise is, or was, my birthstone and I have always loved the stone. Your ring is just what I needed to lift my spirits!!It is well made and and just plain beautiful. Thanx!!!!!

"
"I can not tell you how much I love these rings. I just got the garnet and peridot rings to mix in with the dainty silver rings I bought from Michael earlier this year. They go together beautifully and the sizing is exact. I just love them. Thanks so much and keep up your beautiful art‚òÆÔ∏è
"
"I'm in love with these rings. I first bought the mother's ring two years ago from Alari Design when I was pregnant with my son. Two years later I bought this one to represent the child I just gave birth to as a gestational carrier. I now wear one ring for each child. I'm proud to wear such beautiful and lovingly crafted jewelry. Thank you, Michael! <3
"
"My son‚Äôs birthstone.  I had this artist make three birthstone rings which I wear at the same time.  Really loving my new rings.
"
"This ring is beautiful, fits perfectly, and arrived even sooner than I thought it would. Highly recommend this artist. :-)
"
"Unfortunately I had to make this ring bigger at the jeweler. But that's because I measured my finger size myself. So as a tip, have your fingers measured at the jeweler!
"
"I love love love this Emerald ring! Perfect for everyday ware. I personally love small how dainty most of her rings are. That is one of the reasons I continue to purchase my jewelry  from Ferko. She‚Äôs an amazing artist who can cater to any of your jewelry needs. ‚ù§Ô∏è
"
"This ring is beautiful. I love it. Amazing quality. I love how simple and stunning this is! I‚Äôll definitely order from them again.
"
"The ring got here yesterday just in time for my daughters birthday today. I‚Äôm so excited for her to try it on. It‚Äôs perfect thank you Ferkos.
"
"love this ring! exactly what i wanted. the shopowner was so sweet and gave me an extra ring as well (free of charge!) since she had changed the material she used. I was also able to squeeze it to make it a bit tighter which is great!
"
"Love it! It‚Äôs very light and dainty, but still clearly trek. I also have ever so slightly webbed fingers and it‚Äôs nice to be able to adjust the ring so it lays the way I want it to.
"
"Really fast shipping, and I live in Hawaii! The ring is really cute and true to the pictures. Very happy with my purchase!
"
"Star Trek ring!
Yes! This ring is great. Very lightweight and delicate. Don't do too much it on though. I don't wanna ruin it.
Thanks for helping me be nerdy!

"JUST BUY IT LOL! It took a little over a month to receive it and I did grow impatient, but it was well worth the wait. I ordered a size 7 and it was a perfect fit, Amy was so attentive and responded within minutes! I tried to get a good picture to show how beautiful it is!! Pictures don‚Äôt do justice, thank you Amy!
"
"The ring did take a little longer to complete and get to me, but seller was very responsive. Seller made sure I received exactly what I ordered and this ring is beyond beautiful! This is my engagement ring üíç . I wasn‚Äôt allowed to submit multiple photos so I‚Äôm showing a photo of how the ring looks at night üíó
"
"(Writing this on my future husband's account) This ring is absolutely stunning. We are at the beach and it just sparkles like nothing I've seen before. I cried when I saw it in person. Amy did a great job helping us with what we needed, and we will definitely be coming back for a wedding band!
"
"I am in looooove with my ring. I wore it on 2 separate fingers because I ordered the wrong size, which was my bad, haha. But they do look so good together! And I feel like the rings are really well made and they sparkle so much! Amy was really nice and super patient, I would definitely work with her again! Highly recommend. She answered any questions I had and she even made sure that I received the package the day it stated it was delivered. I didn‚Äôt even know! Keep in mind that Amy is a pretty busy person, so my order did take a while (but what do you expect when everything is made to order?) However, it was definitely well worth it.
"
"This ring is so beautiful! I‚Äôm so happy I bought it. The photo was taken with a flash on. I‚Äôm obsessed!
"
"I love my ring! This is my second ring from this seller and it‚Äôs just as beautiful as my onyx. üôåüèª
"

*update* stone fell out Today. I‚Äôm pretty sure I‚Äôve only had it on around a month, give or take. It‚Äôs too bad Bc it‚Äôs a beautiful ring!
"
"So cute! The ring band has some texture, which I really like in addition to the stone and perfect size. It came with a cute little surprise as well:) thank you! For reference I got a size small stone.

"I received this ring in excellent timing!!!  I had a due date and she did well to make it happen...My review is very overdue which I apologize for.  The ring was as described and looks just like in the pictures.  Melanie was great in responding to questions that I would have about the ring and other things.  I highly recommend her to buy from.
Thanks!

"
"Anna created a gorgeous, one-of-a-kind elephant seal ring! I knew when I saw the Shar pei puppy dog ring that there was a good chance that Anna would be willing to use the same materials to make something else. The end result is awesome!!! There ought to be a picture of it.
"
"LOVE this ring! Awesome quality and beautifully made!
"
"daughter loves her new ring! the wrap is a bit disappointing but the brass detail is lovely.
"
"Beautiful! Reminds me of an engagement ring I lost. Very happy with it.
"
"The blue is a deep and incredible color, and the setting is poetry in silver. It‚Äôs a ring I can easily see wearing all the time. Thank you Jena!
"
"My ring is absolutely beautiful. Very pleased with my purchase. Thank you so much:)
"
"Gorgeous ring. Much smaller ring than I expected but even so, really lovely. Thanks so much!
"
"Absolutely beautiful. 
This was intended as a ""placeholder"" ring until we could afford something in a higher price range, however we're no longer doing that. I'm completely satisfied and in love with this ring. 
Thank you!
Also, shipping was extremely fast it was packed in a nice ring case, including care instructions.
"
"This item was great, well made and shinny.  Has been loved by everyone who has seen it.
"
"This is my engagement ring and I am in love! I got it in about a week and a half, and I haven‚Äôt taken it off since. I get compliments every day üíñ
"
"The most beautiful ring! My fianc√© is so happy and I cannot wait to wear this ring on my finger! Thank you!
"
"Erin did such a beautiful job, this is such a beautiful ring 
The picture doesn‚Äôt do it justice!
"
"I'm wearing them right now. Stack of three looks perfect to me. Beautiful dainty rings . Love them!
"
"This ring is very pretty and well made, and I had an excellent customer service experience with the shop owner! I originally ordered this ring with the matte finish. I wanted to stack it with other rings I have, so I realized I should have ordered the shiny finish. I was able to send the ring back to have it refinished, I also had it sized down slightly. All I had to do is pay for the shipping. I am really happy with my purchase and with the experience I had with the shop!
"
"Love this dainty, little pearl ring!!! It stacks well with other rings I have ordered from this site and it is super sturdy and strong! My order was also shipped very quickly!!!
"
"It's a lovely ring. With the gold accents, it will be a great everyday ring to wear with gold or silver. Beautiful design.
"
"Diana heeft deze ring op verzoek gemaakt. Ze was zeer vriendelijk en behulpzaam met het bedenken van een mooi geheel. De ring was keurig op tijd en nog mooier dan ik van tevoren had gehoopt en heb m'n vriendin er erg blij mee gemaakt.
"
"Een prachtige ring die ik met trots draag. Met liefde gemaakt, dat kun je zien. Elk detail klopt.
"
 
"The ring is fabulous, just like the silver ball necklace. The finish of the ball is amazing. The surface sparkles beautifully with the special structure and is still smooth.
"
"Item as described and arrived in a reasonable time frame considering sent from overseas :)
"
"Fabulous does not BEGIN to describe this piece. Absolutely gorgeous on the finger ! I love it ... it is the kind of piece that you  would not choose to accent an outfit but rather build your look around ....arrived fast and well protected too , a wonderful shopping experience !
thank you !
"
"Beautiful ring! Great communication! Shipped on time.
"
"I can‚Äôt stop staring at my new engagement ring! Honestly it‚Äôs one of the prettiest rings I‚Äôve ever seen. My fianc√© is very proud of it and I‚Äôm a very happy fianc√©e. He says his favorite part is how much I love it. Lena was amazing and patient answering all our questions about fitting it with wedding bands we had from my grandma. She even gave us a little sneak video to help with our excitement (though to be honest it was all my excitement)!  Shipping was incredibly fast! I hear nothing but compliments when people notice my ring!
"
"Absolutely beautiful ring! I was very apprehensive about buying without seeing but Lena was very communicative and I‚Äôd read all the reviews beforehand. It‚Äôs so stunning! The halo ring means a lot to me as I sadly lost my Dad in May and I wanted something beautiful to look at every day that reminds me of my lovely,  shining star. Thank you Lena x
"
"I just received my rings! I was pretty nervous ordering such a high dollar item on the internet but I will buy all of my jewelry from Lena at SevenCarat! The rings are absolutely stunning and everything I had hoped!
"
"Love love love love love. The top photo shows the contrast in direct sunlight, and the bottom is inside. Depending on the lighting the grey will be more pronounced. (The colors seen in the bottom photo are from a stained glass window reflecting nearby!) I absolutely love this ring and am so glad we chose to order from Lena. She answered any and every question I had and the ring took only 3 days to arrive once shipped. After spending weeks looking for a salt and pepper diamond, I was thrilled to come across this listing. If you are even considering a salt and pepper diamond, do not hesitate to inquire about this beauty!
"
"In love

"My mother passed away February 9th. She was 52 years old. She died from covid pneumonia. So as you can tell it was very unexpected. She was my best friend . My person. We live in Louisiana so back in 2016 we went through the 100 year flood and she lost everything she owned . So she didn‚Äôt have very much when she passed away. She didn‚Äôt own any jewelry and I‚Äôve always been a ring type of girl. When I came across these rings they were my favorite out of all the name rings I‚Äôve seen on Etsy . I ordered one and it came very quickly . It‚Äôs beautiful and a great way for me to remember my mama by. Thank you so much for my ring! I love it
"
"I LOVE MY RING! My order was received very quickly once it shipped. The seller was very helpful and even showed me additional fonts to chose from. My ring is better than I imagined and I will buy matching earrings soon too! My packaging was beautiful, and added to the experience. I am so happy!
"
"I received my ring today. I ordered it for my fiancee and we are so happy with our purchase! It came 2 days earlier than expected and the quality is great! She put it on immediately with a big smile on her face! Thank you for creating such a beautiful piece! We will most definitely be ordering from you in the future!
"
"Absolutely love my new ring! I have very tiny fingers so I love small dainty rings. It was sized perfectly and sits quite nicely on my middle finger!
"
"LOVE this ring! The one class I am teaching in person this term is outside, and the kyanite practically glows in the sunlight! The wire work is perfect and the ring is just gorgeous. üíôüíç
"
"I am so thrilled with this ring I had a hard time taking it off! In real life it is even way prettier than the picture on the website and it is so well made, I can feel the care the artist put into her work üëçüëçüëç
"
"Absolutely a gorgeous piece!! And the price was fair. Thank you so much for the perfect piece to my jewelry collection!! Love it!!
"
"I absolutely love this ring. It is perfect. I probably should have gone with a slightly smaller size because in the winter time it will def just fall off. But I'll just order another one in the right size and have two of these. This ring is just gorgeous. Shipping was fast too.
"
"Love my ring!!! It‚Äôs so delicate and so pretty . I will def buy more rings from this shop !
"
"Again this ring with the other are very beautiful and the seller was very easy to work with! I‚Äôve had this ring for about a month now. No tarnish but since it is so dainty it does bend little. But it doesn‚Äôt bother me! Still a very beautiful ring! Excellent seller will definitely be buying more jewelry in the future!
"
"Beautiful!!! Looks just like the pictures. Good quality, arrived fast, and came in a nice ring box.  I loved my ring so much I ordered another ring from this seller the same day my ring arrived:)
"
"Thank you Mary! And Koten Studios! I ordered this back drop necklace in silver and it is absolutely stunning! I will be wearing it New Year's Eve with a V backed black dress for a Phantom of the Opera theme.  Perfect! And on top of that, I requested matching earrings which were made just for me and they came today. Wow! Very fast on the shipping! If you are thinking of purchasing anything from this amazing artist,  do it.  You will not be disappointed!  If I could fill in more stars, I would!
Pam
"
"Wore these 1 day, and had so many compliments on them. Love these!
"
"These are SO beautiful!! They are dainty but I have long, thick, curly hair and you can still see them when my hair is down! The color is gorgeous!!
"
"Incredibly sexy and gorgeous. It is delicate and I keep worrying I‚Äôm going to break it but I love it.
"
"It took awhile to receive it, but this beautiful garnet ring was well worth the wait.  It is incredibly beautiful.  I love, love, love it!!!!
"
"The photos does this ring no justice and the customer service is impeccable! I love it! I WILL be back! I‚Äôve got my eye on that white topaz ring! ;)
"
"This ring is absolutely beautiful and I so pleased with it. I am looking forward to purchasing more with different colored stones. Again, I‚Äôm very happy with my ring and the size is perfect.‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
"
"This ring is absolutely beautiful. I absolutely love it...i will be definitely ordering more jewelry from this shop...breath taking it reminds me of my grandmother's jewelry collection
"
"It‚Äôs here! And it is beautiful and it fits!

Thankyou so much!
"
"Absolutely love my new ring it fit perfect and will definitely but more jewelry from your shop
"
"The quality of the ring is so beautiful and is so pretty when you wear it! I would personally go a half size up next time i order again to have a little bit more room when putting it on. But my ring got here before my expected delivery date as well (:
"
"This ring is absolutely beautiful! VERY good quality!!
"
"Beautiful ring but upon further inspection the little ""claws"" that hold the opal are not like shown in the pictures. They more pointy and not very even (one sits higher than the stone, not making contact). I'm worried those pointy bits will snag on blankets or clothes. I decided to buy this ring specifically because those claws were pictured as smooth & rounded over. I'm disappointed because this is going to be a gift for my girlfriend and now I'm worried it will have issues.

EDIT: It is snagging on everything and now I have to take it somewhere to fix the issue. Quite disappointed
"
"The ring is a dream! ü•∞  the quality is very high. It fits perfekt and the diamonds are sparkling. Its 14k solid gold.
Couldn't be happier! 
It fits allone or with my promisses-ring.
The delivery fast fast and the communication with the seller was very friendly. 
 
I will give 1000 stars* and would order again! I'm in love and admire it all the time! Thank you! üòç
"
"Absolutely love this ring! I had it custom made in 18k white gold. The seller was quick to respond and adjust to my request. Thank you very much! I will be wearing it permanently üòä
"
"I bought this ring for my best friend and she loved it! :) Thank you so much for designing a beautiful ring! The only thing I would have liked is a certificate of authenticity included with the ring but it‚Äôs still a gorgeous piece.
"
"I was drawn to the look of this piece from Instagram and then fell in love with the concept! Unique one off jewelry with real gem stones at a size that i would never normally be able to afford!!
 The ring came the exact size i wanted, the color of the emerald is perfect, exactly as the picture and the box along with all of the packaging really added to the luxury feel of jewelry. Will be looking out for another piece soon!
"
"Absolutely beautiful! Fits on the chain my grandparents gave me like a dream. I love it!
"
"Excellent service - my ring was resized and delivered super quickly.

My ring is absolutely beautiful - the sapphire is such a gorgeous deep colour and I love how it is so different with its inclusions. 

Love the concept of this shop! It‚Äôs such a great idea.
"
"Jo is so lovely and the necklace is really beautiful. The meaning behind the necklace and why I bought it is very special to me. What‚Äôs also meaningful is the concept of loving flaws and having jewellery represent that. My little necklace means everything to me and I‚Äôll treasure it for the rest of my life. Thank you Jo! 

(In my photo I‚Äôve switched around the pendant and chain)
"
"I love it...it's beautiful 
I'm so glad I sized it right as it fits perfectly
Thank u üíú
"
"Wish it was a little lighter of a blue, like in the picture. Looks pretty close to the onyx one I got, but otherwise I love it. Thank you!
"
"The ring is so sparkly and beautiful, even nicer than the picture. I especially like the detailwork on the band, so pretty. Thank you!
"
"Love my ring! Thank you, Tammy! üíó
"
"5+++ STARS! This ring is absolutely stunning! I would buy over and over again from this seller. They are truly talented. I bought a 14k white sapphire. Love, love, love!  I literally have my dream ring.
"
"I just got my ring today. Zhedora was kind and helpful. I got the white saphire 14k rose gold. In size 6.5. I ordered my ring May 19th and I recieved it May 29th paying for the express shipping. Today is my first day wearing it, if feels snug but I dont wear rings so that could just be my problem because the ring is absolutley beautiful and perfect and feels sturdy. Its worth it!!! Thank you!
"
"Getting this right was a bit of an ordeal. And it's because I'm located in Florida and it was ready about the time Irma was headed right for us. The seller had enough foresight to hold my package until after the storm passed and then shipped it. She also calmed my panic when I asked if it had gotten lost in the craziness on its way down, she also asked how my family was and sent positive thoughts our way during our conversation. So not only is their customer service top notch and compassionate the craftsmanship is superb. I nearly cried it was so beautiful. My ring is in rose gold even though my picture is in black and white. I would highly recommend this seller and would purchase again.
"
"I received my ring almost two weeks ago. I wanted to wait to write an honest review since i spent a lot of time reading almost all of the reviews. The ring is perfect for me. I don't care too much for mined diamonds. I feel they're really not worth the money imo having worked in the diamond industry. I will say the band is really thin but im fine with it since i will stack with 2 wedding bands. Also it definitely does look like a cz, if you're not into that id go with a moissy.  I personally could care less what anyone thinks of my ring. Its my ring and i love it.! I wear a size 6 for reference  (: photo was taken right after i opened the box!
"
"The ring is absolutely beautiful. Thank you for rushing and getting it delivered in time for the holidays.
"
"The ring was a wonderful gift for my wife. The packaging was nice and the delivery was prompt. Very satisfied with the product as well as the seller!!
"
 
 
"(Don‚Äôt mind my chipped nail polish lol) This ring is absolutely beautiful! I love the angelite and the wire is wrapped in a really pretty design! Would definitely recommend to anyone looking at this ring üòç
"
"I am thrilled that I found this shop!  This Angelite ring is just one of my most recent purchases.  The stainless steel gives it a perfect look, especially along side oxidized jewelry.  The design is unique and very comfortable!  If I could, I would buy one in every stone available! This is certainly a nice addition to my jewelry collection.
"
"Beautiful ring. Perfect size. I love the wire wrapping. I bought this angelite wrap wring to help heal on a spiritual level and connect with my unborn child. I‚Äôm in love with the way it looks and the way I feel when wearing it.
"
"This shade of blue is entrancing and a top color I've always loved and been drawn to! I have purchased many rings at once and always immediately wind up picking a favorite. But these three are equally beautiful and flawless and I will never get tired of looking at them!! This shop is a favorite and I couldn't recommend it more!!üëçüëç‚ù§‚ù§
"
"I have several of Galyna's rings. They are all so beautiful and beautifully made.  I also now have a really pretty pair of her earrings.  I can't say enough how happy I am with my purchases.
"
"The ring is stunning and the care taken to package it came straight from the heart. Thank you!!
"
"These are spectacular I love love love them high quality and colors are vibrant and I‚Äôm always surprised with her quality and colors are so beautiful‚Äîalso they are not too heavy for my ears and I‚Äôm older and my ears pull down and these work!  Durability appears to be there as well‚ÄîI just received all of her earrings so hoping they will last and I‚Äôm very careful with these kinds of earrings‚Äîso very happy with purchase always and ordered three more because these are my outfits working on zoom all the time!
"
"Super adorable!! I bought them for my wedding and they were absolutely perfect for our butterfly bluff ceremony. I've gotten so many compliments on them, I can't wait to wear them more.
"
 
 
"I wanted a cute sparkly chevron ring I could stack, and this one fit the bill, and also my finger, perfectly!
"
"Super pretty and she made me a specialized size! My 3rd ring from here and it won‚Äôt be the last!
"
"Thank you! I think birthstones are the prettiest way to remember your loved ones and this ring is just what I was looking for. I really like how the faceted band compliments the stone and that I can stack it or not. The color is slightly deeper than the picture, which I like. Shipped when promised, even though I screwed up the original shipping address-  Overall, I am very happy with this purchase and will recommend to family and friends.
"
"Pretty green ring! Love the gold with it, really sets it off well. Stacks well with other rings. True to size and comfortable fit. Arrived quickly in a pretty box.
"
"When I bought this ring I couldn't make up my mind between it and another birthstone ring.  I decided to get both and I am so glad that I did.  Slightly different looks but both are of high quality and  great design.  I love this seller's items!
"
"Very beautiful ring! Delezhen is my favourite shop! I want to collect all rings with gemstones different colours ))) Perfect seller!
"
"I‚Äôve been on the hunt for forever for a fossilized coral ring. I really like how I was able to pick which one I wanted. And I‚Äôm glad it came in multiple size options.
"
"This is a great ring! The design is interesting, yet subtle. The color is neutral enough to go with any outfit. The size is just right for me! Thanks! It was so fun to have a package at my new house right away!
"
"Absolutely love my Petoskey ring! Arrived so quickly and the craftsmanship is so clean and perfect!
"
"I love my new ring, reminds me of summers by Lake Michigan, thank you so much!
"
"Absolutely love my new ring üíÖüèª‚ú®‚ù§Ô∏è
"
"Such a beautiful ring. I get compliments everywhere. So many in fact, that I just had to buy the blue one too! :)
"
"My fifth ring from Carrie, and it is stunning! Thank you!
"
"Absolutely gorgeous as always. The workmanship is flawless. Thx!
"
"It's a gorgeous ring. It my birthday present to myself. I will be 58 years old. The style is classic and very flattering. The peach stone is oval and large and extremely pretty. I just love it. I am grateful that I was able to order it and that you were able to ship it given that the pandemic in India is really terrible right now.Stay safe and stay healthy!
"
"Beautiful ring. I wasn't expecting the stone to be as big and, unfortunately, the ring flops over to one side or the other of my finger. I wear a 7.5 and I think a size 7 would be too small for me. This peach-color Morganite, sterling silver ring is very much a ""cocktail"" ring! But I'm enjoying wearing it any time of the day at home. It makes me smile. I would order from this company again (but I would look more closely at the size of the stone in order to not have the top-heavy shift). Thank you!
"
"I love this ring!!  I requested the ring be 9.25; it is.  The stone is lovely, the silver shiny.  The color is gorgeous, very unusual.  The ring arrived much sooner than I had expected.  The ring looks expensive and it wasn't.  Great product and service, I will be purchasing more products from this seller soon.  Ann in Washington State, USA
"
"oh my goodness this ring is amazing!  I love morganite and this ring truly goes with everything.  It's perfect.  Very fast shipping
"
"This ring is pure magic.  The center stone is AMAZING, even more beautiful than promised.  And the exquisite handmade setting makes it sing!!!

I have been a passionate collector of this artist's work for many years.  Ivan's pieces are always a true gift to the eye, hand, and spirit.  Confession: they are SO special that, when my box arrives, I often wait for days or even weeks to open it! I have to wait until just the right moment, when I truly have time to celebrate the event for the special occasion it is.  Unlike other sellers, I never have to worry about the quality or fit of Ivan's work.  I love welcoming a new piece into my home--and heart!

You cannot do better than to order from this shop.
"
"Have you ever found an artist on Etsy whose work you loved so much that you knew anything you ordered from his shop would be extraordinary?  And then, when your order arrived, it was so much MORE than even you had expected that it took your breath away?  That's what happened to me with this emerald ring.  I knew from the pictures that it would be beautiful visually, and that Ivan would do his usual professional job of resizing and careful shipping.  What I hadn't expected was how amazing this unusual setting would feel to wear.  The silver is shaped so organically it almost feels like a natural part of my finger.  Thank you, Ivan, for another wonderful piece.
"
"This is a truly beautiful ring, so beautiful I'm having a hard time coming up with the right words to do it justice!  Ivan is clearly one of those rare artists who can see into the soul of a stone and then create a setting for it that makes it sing.  He was able to re-size the ring to fit my slightly odd quarter-size perfectly, and the package arrived safely at my west-coast USA home with lightning speed.  I couldn't be happier with my purchase. It's one of the most exquisite pieces in my entire jewelry collection.
"
"The ring was beautiful and excellently made. Ivan was excellent to business with and kept me informed through the process. I HIGHLY recommend to anyone to browse and use his services. I will definitely do business with him again. Thank you for a beautiful wedding anniversary gift!!!!!!
"
"This ring is really cute and dainty. I love the way it looks. The only reason I gave four stars is because it's a little bit flimsy. It gets hooked on things when I reach into my purse or just on my clothes throughout the day, and it will bend and lose shape if that happens. The good side of that is that it's easy to bend it back into shape! Still looks cute!
"
"Love love the whale tail ring and necklace. I got it for my sister for her birthday. We had a special trip to Monterey and went whale watching. These are the perfect way to hold on to the special memory. About to order one for myself, other sister and mom!
"
"Adorable ring! I really do love it, though the edges can catch on clothes, which causes the tail to bend a bit. It can be pushed back in place easily, however. 
I haven't taken the ring off yet :)
"
"Have to be careful when you wear ring since it is made of soft silver can bend easily.
"
 
"The one word that comes to mind when I look at my ring is that it is STUNNING! It is truly beautiful & certainly makes a statement. The red color of the amber stone is so unique & the silver band with leaf detail really compliments it. I can‚Äôt stop staring at it when I wear it. And Magda was so helpful & quick to respond to my questions on sizing. Excellent customer service. And bonus: my ring arrived about a week sooner than expected.
"
"Absolutely love my amber earrings! They are a gorgeous color & I love the oval shape. The first time I wore them, I received many compliments. Shipping was really fast too - they arrived about a week earlier than expected.
"
"I love this ring! beautifully made with a gorgeous piece of amber.  This was despatched and arrived quickly.  Thank you so very much! I will be back for more pieces for my collection.
"
"The ring looks lovely.
But I never received it. 
Tracking shows it has been sitting in another state here in the U.S for a month.
Etsy has refunded me.
*Update 060121
I did receive my ring. It is lovely. The mail is just taking a lot longer than seems right
I am very happy with my purchase and I let Etsy know I received it.  It is a lovely ring and the artist is very talented.
"
"Absolutely stunning!!!
"
"This jewelry is beautifully made. Takes a little while to reach U.S but worth the wait. I have several beautiful pieces.
"
"Buena calidad, muy bonito y comunicaci√≥n f√°cil con el vendedor. Un diez.
"
"The craftsmanship of this ring is phenomenal and I am so in love with my ring!! The only issue I have is something that is my OWN fault, not the shop owners whatsoever, I didn't size my finger correctly so it's too small for the finger I originally wanted to wear it on and too big for my smaller fingers, and the only reason I am including this in my review is to let others know to know your size for sure!! Otherwise you will be sad like I am but I can still wear it, I just have to be careful. I got mine with labadorite and I have to say this is one of the most beautiful pieces of labadorite I have ever seen, my photo doesn't do oringo's work justice! Will be purchasing again (next time I will know my FOR SURE ring size‚ò∫)
"
"This ring is marvelous- exactly as pictured, the serpentine stone gives it  very foresty feeling. The ring is well made, and the seller worked with me on some timing concerns, so overall 100% recommend this shop!
"
"This ring is amazing! Look as gorgeous as in the pictures. It's finely crafted to the smallest detail. Shipping was unexpectedly fast even though I live in Asia. Would definitely buy more pieces from Oringo!
"
"It‚Äôs perfect! Exactly as pictured, very good quality. I‚Äôve worn it almost every day since receiving it and not a scratch on it! Beautiful, thank you so much!  ‚ù§Ô∏è
"
"This ring looks just like the video. It is gorgeous and shipped quickly.
"
"The ring looks absolutely beautiful. The stone looks beautifully cut. Shipping was fairly fast. seller communication is great. You get a tracking number. Can't get over how beautiful the ring looks. fits perfectly on my finger and just looks stunning. I keep getting compliments on how nice it looks!
"
"I seen this ring, and fell in love with it. It is absolutely beautiful in person. I was so excited, to finally have purchased it, and haven‚Äôt taken it off since I received it. The package came sooner than expected, and it was wrapped with so much care. I highly recommend this jeweler. There are other pieces, I‚Äôve had my eye on. And will definitely be placing more orders in the future.
"
"A really beautiful ring, and I‚Äôve already received several compliments on it! A bit smaller visually than I had imagined, but it matches the dimensions listed. I‚Äôm really happy I bought this ring and would not hesitate to purchase again from this shop!
"
"Ich bin super zufrieden mit dem Ring! Es hat ein wenig gedauert, aber das ist ja auch kein Wunder, wenn der Ring aus Indien kommt. Das hatte ich zugegebener Ma√üen √ºbersehen. Aber er ist sehr s√º√ü verpackt mit einem netten Zettel, in dem um eine positive Bewertung gebeten wird. Zudem hat die Person in Kauf genommen 3 Dollar f√ºr den Versand zu zahlen. Ich hatte jedenfalls das Gef√ºhl, etwas ganz Besonderes von einer Person bekommen zu haben, die unendlich dankbar ist, dass ich diesen Ring gekauft habe. Danke!
"
"Finally got my larimar ring! It took a while to get here like the seller said, but it was worth the wait. And they gave me a free gift! (The midi ring on my middle finger)
"
"I absolutely loved my ring! Size is dead on! Love it!!
"
"The ring is gorgeous! It features a nice, big piece of polished and (possibly dyed) turquoise with many interesting veins. It has a lot of character, and looks just like the picture. The price for this ring was also very reasonable; a great deal, in my opinion. I may order more jewelry from this shop in the future. Thank you, Ani! üíê
"
"My husband proposed with the matching marquise opal ring two years ago and I've been SO excited to get this matching band, and after all that buildup it's even better than I'd hoped. They fit together perfectly and comfortably, the staff were so polite and helpful, the ring arrived sooner than expected, and I've lost track of how many strangers have complemented them! ‚ù§Ô∏è I love them endlessly, thank you MinimalVS
"
"This exceeded my expectations!!! My ring is absolutely stunning & nests seamlessly with my engagement ring (which I bought from another vendor). 
Customer service was impeccable. Quick responses & always willing to answer my questions! 
If you‚Äôre considering purchasing this ring.. let this be your sign to pull the trigger!
"
"Such a gorgeous and elegant ring, simple yet original. Perfect. I was worried it would not match the picture, but I was wrong. The ring is exactely as presented, though thicker than I imagined. The seller has been responsive and patient and the ring arrived way way sooner than expected. I am absolutely delighted I chose this ring as my wedding ring.
"
"Honestly, it could not have gone better. We had a very bad experience with a previous jeweler, and came here to try and get our custom ring made. They were so patient throughout the whole process helping us build out or design, despite what felt like us asking a million questions!

They produced a mockup, and modified it according to our design wishes, and were always prompt in answering our questions. They also did and excellent job re-cutting the stone we selected for our center mount. Shipping was a breeze (and fast!), and the ring is truly stunning. My fiance loves the ring, I love the ring, and the whole process was a wonderful experience of what working with a custom jeweler should be. I could not recommend this store more, and will consider them first for any custom jewelry jobs in the future!

"It's gorgeous , than you my daughter loves it üòä
"
"I love love love this beautiful delicate ring!
"
"Absolutely beautiful piece of jewelry! It's so nice and lightweight that I haven't taken it off since it arrived!
"
"Beautiful ring! I love it and it arrived quickly from overseas. :) Thank you!
"
"Je suis enchant√©e de mon achat, la labradorite et la bague sont magnifiques. Merci pour votre travail et l'envoi de ce bijou. Belle continuation !!!
"
"I love the design of the metal and it looks more elegant in the light.  Thank you so much!
"
"Beautiful ring! Fits perfectly! Quality for the price! Love it! Thank you!
"
"Not a fan.  The stone is a bit bigger than I had anticipated.  I don't believe there were any dimensions listed on the site so I tried to guestimate by the pictures.  The marquis setting is just under 3/4 inch, in case anyone is interested.  Even with my large fingers, the marquise was just too big.  The stone/glass wasn't what I was expecting either.  It's really translucent.  I have several labradorite stones at  home and thought the stone would be more solid, not translucent.  The ring came in a timely manner so no complaints there.  Lesson learned here is to contact the seller for dimensions if none are given.
"
"Where to begin! This little ring is absolutely gorgeous. The pictures simply don't it justice: it really is flawless. I gave it as a gift to my girlfriend and she absolutely loves it. It's such a special ring: it sits nicely, the moonstone is lovely, and the rose gold adds a wonderful effect. The best part about the whole transaction was the service. Elena was very sweet (and quite patient with my inability to accurately guess the correct ring size). When I panicked at the last minute and asked her to send a different size, she shipped another within two days and told me to just send whichever one didn't fit back to her, no problems! I didn't actually get around to shipping the ring back until about a month later, and Elena was totally understanding and refunded the ring cheerfully. I only wish I could leave more stars!
"
"Love this ring. It's unique and my now fianc√© loves its. I am sad though, I opted for the plated rose gold. And it's fading already üò£
I guess I'll save up and buy the actual rose gold ring someday.
"
"this ring is absolutely gorgeous. the picture doesn't even do it justice. I just received it in the mail this morning (super fast delivery btw! I ordered it on the 19th and today is the 24th. the shop is in California and I'm in Georgia!) and I have already received many compliments while wearing it. the moonstone is much smaller than I expected it to be, but that's perfectly okay because I'm so in love with its beauty. thank you so much!
"
"I am so in love with my ring. I couldn‚Äôt be happier with the blue tint in the moonstone.
"
"I absolutely love my ring. I've been looking for dupe styles similar to Lisa Eldridge's rings. I especially find it rare to come across horizontal oval shaped rings which I absolutely love. Will be purchasing more in the future!!üíç‚ù§Ô∏è
"
"This is a beautiful ring!  The combo of rose gold and morganite is striking. This is the second ring that I have purchased from UrbanCarats and I‚Äôve already ordered a third.  I love this shop!
"
"Beautiful craftsmanship!  The finish on the gold and Morganite are beautifully done.  The sizing is perfect.  It took a reasonable amount of time considering it was custom made.  I am back for a second piece!
"
"My rings are even more beautiful in person.  And the un boxing experience was an unexpected touch of making me feel extra special.

Thank you
"
"This ring is beautiful! Same as picture! But it's too big for my fingers. I wear 5.5 for my ring finger and 6.5 for my middle finger but it's still too big so I have to wear it with my index finger (7.5) ... Hope it helps.
"
"This ring is super cute. I didn't realize it was coming from the Ukraine when I purchased it, so it arrived about a week after Christmas. My fault, not theirs. Cute packaging, sweet little ring. Would definitely shop here again.
"
"I love how beautiful this ring is!! The price was great & the craftsmanship was wonderful. Unfortunately, I lost it (my fault) & will have to order another one. Can‚Äôt wait to get more!

"I love this ring. It's a little bit lightweight than expected but beautiful never the less.
"
"love my citrine ring!!! it arrived quickly as usual! thank you!
"
"Very cute ring. Just what I expected. Size matched perfectly. Shipping was fairly quick for an international shipping. Seller us highly recommended.
"
"Beautiful ring. I love the details around the citrine. 

Thank You.
"
"the ring is of solid quality and was shipped relatively quick, I have no complaints about the ring. It looks exactly like its picture and has a quality feel in the hand. But most of all, the customer service was unparalleled. I'm a guy who wants to spend as little time in a store as possible so I order most of my things online, especially gifts around Christmas time, and I can say Michael from Alaridesign personally messaged me with info on when the ring was to be made and shipped out. This felt like a game changer for me as it felt very personal and it really stands out from the rest of the vendors that I dealt with. I will be buying from these guys again.
"
"This ring is so beautiful!! I've gotten a lot of compliments on it too. Initially I had ordered the wrong size, but it was super easy to send it back and get the right size.
"
"This ring is great.  I had no idea it would be so pretty!  I absolutely love it!
"
"Absolutely gorgeous! Awesome quality, beautiful design, impeccable craftsmanship! The fit is perfect and true to size. Came beautifully packaged, and the customer service was unparalleled from start to finish. Shipped on time, and delivered earlier than expected. Overall, I'm a VERY happy customer and fully intend on ordering again. :D LOVE IT!!!!
"
"Simple but gorgeous ring that suits my fiance's style and personality perfectly. It was a big hit with her. Ring was crafted and shipped in a very timely manner and vendor was very receptive and easy to communicate with. All in all a great Etsy experience here, and I would absolutely shop with this vendor again.
"
"Dainty and oh so pretty! Love it!
Adore the teardrop design.
Thanks!
"
"Exactly what I wanted. Appears beautifully and well-crafted. I have small thin, fingers, and the ‚Äúdaintyness,‚Äù as advertised, is perfect. I would highly recommend doing business with Liesel Love.
"
"I purchased for my mom's birthday- it's beautiful, fits perfectly and shipped early. Thank you!
"
"I am so in Love with this ring! It is everything I had hoped for and the maker/seller Kipkalinka Jewels was extremely helpful and on top of the entire purchase. I would recommend this jeweler to anyone! The ring is gorgeous
"
"My rings have arrived. What can I say?? They are absolutely stunning. The detail on the skulls is amazing, they fit together seamlessly and are a perfect fit. I‚Äôm totally blown away with everything and I can‚Äôt thank you enough. I‚Äôm so pleased that I also purchased the matching wedding ring. I shall enjoy wearing these for many years to come
"
"Ich bin einfach nur begeistert! Der Kontakt mit Christine war super nett und der Ring ist wundesch√∂√∂√∂√∂√∂n!! ‚ù§Ô∏èWir sicher nicht meine einzige Bestellung bleiben. Lieben Danküòä
"
"Amazing ring, it arrived very quickly and fitted perfectly. Great communication! Will definitely buy more from kipkalinka.thanks a lot!!!!!
"
"Honestly so in love with it. Its slightly smaller than I thought it would be but that makes me love it more because I love smaller jewlery. Im so happy with it!
"
"The ring is beautiful! It took a while to get here and I never got a response to my questions and requests
"
"the stone is just the right size, not too big or small. from the pictures i kinda expected a dark green stone but im pleasantly surprised that's it's dark blue instead. shipping took a while but that's expected since its coming from Israel. Overall, I love it.
"
"Very pretty dainty ring. The color in the stone is very vibrant. Good communication. Be sure your not in a hurry and read her time line as it takes that long to receive. Worth waiting for tho.
"
"This was my first experience on Etsy and it will not be my last! The quality of the ring is outstanding but the customer service won me over before its arrival. Thank you so much!
"
"I love my ring!!!  Beautiful!  Thank you so much!
"
"Prachtige ring! Ik draag hem elke dag en ik ben er zo blij mee
Levering was vlot netjes en zorgvuldig verpakt. ook telefonische vragen werden heel netjes en vriendelijk beantwoord.
"
"The quality and customer service provided were ridiculously amazing. I bought this as a gift and feel it will be a piece we will see love for it for generations. It‚Äôs really well done.
"
"I‚Äôm in love with this ring! Amazing quality, shipping took a little longer than I‚Äôd like but who cares lol it‚Äôs worth the wait!
"
"Ordered it on the 11th, came on the 19th (to the UK). Fits really well - my ring size was between a US 5 and 6, so I ordered a 6 and it fits perfectly! It's really pretty and dainty - a very good impulse buy! Will most likely be ordering from the shop again! :)
"
"OMG I love this ring, it did take a longtime for it to come but that usually is because they take the time to really make a quality piece of jewelry. Definitely worth the wait as far as I'm concerned, I also purchased two necklaces from this same seller and they are both exquisite. I'll definitely be buying form this seller again in the future.
"
"Its very pretty! I am super happy with it! :-)
"
"Parfait
"
"Gorgeous ring!! Love how dainty and elegant it is! Exactly what I was hoping for!
"
"Superbe, fine, d√©licate c est mon 2e achat chez Petite Vagabonde, les bijoux sont de tr√®s bonne qualit√© et ne bougent pas. Je recommande ++
"
"Tr√®s belle bague et livraison rapide üëçüèªüëåparfait!
"
"Amazing! Exactly what I‚Äôve been looking for. Quick shipping too. Small scratch but it‚Äôs ok for the price. I‚Äôm still very happy. It‚Äôs a beautiful Kelly green when it catches the light.
"
"I absolutely love this ring. I am very picky when it comes to stones and settings. This one meets all my expectations. It is obviously a natural stone and the setting is a joy to wear, there are no uncomfortable spots at all. Currently my favorite ring to wear. Thanks much!
"
"Looks like a wild emerald! Like others have commented, the inclusions add to the stone, and it could pass as a wild emerald. I'm happy that the stone is substantial. It gives good finger coverage. It's a pretty emerald green, and actually goes well with my much more costly emerald jewelry, but is casual enough to wear every day. It's comfortable too.
"
"so pretty! I have received so many compliments on this lovely ring. fits perfect, and I love how big it is!
"
"Genial trabajo de Soraya con el anillo.
Lo compr√© como anillo de compromiso y no ha podido tener m√°s √©xito. Piedra natural preciosa.
Soraya es una magn√≠fica artesana que ha estado atenta a todo detalle del proceso y resuelto cada duda . Muy eficiente en el desarrollo y el env√≠o.
Seguiremos atentos a su trabajo porque estaremos encantados de repetir.
Gracias!
"
"Super contento con la atenci√≥n recibida. Fu√≠ muy pesado para no equivocarme con la talla de anillo de mi chica, y Soraya me atendi√≥ todas las veces con mucha atenci√≥n y paciencia. Me alegro de haberte elegido para mi compra.
Repetir√© sin duda!!!!!
"
"El resultado de este anillo personalizado es estupendo. La piedra es maravillosa; pensaba, en un principio, en realizarlo con turquesa, pero ha quedado m√†s bonito a√πn. El tama√±o es c√≤modo para diario, incluso parec√¨a m√†s grande en la foto. As√¨ est√† genialüòä. Como siempre, las joyas resultan mucho m√†s bonitas al natural que captadas por el objetivo. Me encant√≤. Tambi√®n mencionar la caja y lazo tan monos con los que lo he recibido, y el buen trato amable de Soraya. Un saludo! Gracias!
"
"Me encanta el anillo!! ,Estoy s√∫per contenta con la compra ,todos sus peque√±os detalles lo hacen muy  bonito y original ,y a pesar de las fechas cercanas al d√≠a de reyes me lleg√≥ enseguida.
"
"I received this beautiful ring before the expected delivery date.  The ring is gorgeous it loves to get attention.  People comment on the color of the stone - it catches their attention.  I am very happy with this purchase and will definitely be a return shopper from this Etsy seller.  Thanks!
"
"I love this ring!! I get so many compliments on it and it is adjustable so I can still wear it when my hands swell.
"
"A beautiful ring that arrived super quickly and is a joy to wear. Thank you so much! I‚Äôll be back again soon to buy more. Xx
"
"Thank you  so much dear
"
"The ring came in a timely fashion, the presentation was immaculate and the price is unbeatable.
Than you for the dedication to your work.
"
"Beautiful.  Item was as pictured.
"
 
"We purchased this ring on June 1st and it arrived on June 20th. A little early from the estimated time frame which was wonderful! The ring is beautiful and absolutely worth it. The only concern we had was a few of the prongs on the center stone were slightly lifted. When I contacted Olive Ave, they sent us the shipping label for 2-day Fedex to have it sent back to them to repair/resize. I was only without the ring for a week, and it was returned with all prongs appropriately fixed and perfectly resized. I appreciate all of the communication, effort, and quality from this company. We plan to purchase our wedding bands from Olive Ave as well. Thank you for everything!
"
"Regular pictures cannot do this ring justice. It's beautiful, well made and elegant. I've always had a hard time finding rings to fit my tiny fingers (ring finger size 4.5) but this is perfect!
"
"Ring is beautiful and exactly as pictured/described. I wear it everyday! Luo was also a pleasure to communicate with - very quick and courteous with his responses. I look forward to buying something again from his shop in the future. Thank you!
"
 
"I was anxious about ordering a ring online but am so pleased with my purchase! It arrived in the US 13 days after ordering and it is just beautiful. The alexandrite is stunning and changes from a lighter teal in the sunlight to a darker blue/ green/ purple and everywhere in between while indoors. Very hard to capture on camera as the lens tends to distort the color to a lighter purple. Tried to include different photos but they really don't do the colors justice. I customized to a white gold band and moissanite accent stones which are beautiful as well. Appears well-made and I love that it doesn't sit too high on my finger.
"
"Absolutely stunning in person and it fit her perfect! In love
"
"I love this ring! Where the band meets the stone seems like it could be a little smoother, but with winter dryness, my hands could be extra sensitive.
"
"Beautiful ring!  I love it.  Thank you so much!
"
"Very elegant. Good quality, perfect accent for any outfit.
"
"I loved the packaging and you can tell that every package is made with care, my expectations were beyond met and the quality is amazing, what I found funny was that malachite is apart of the heart chakra and funny enough my malachite has a marbled heart on it which is beautiful, overall im definitely gonna buy from these lovely people again üíñ
"
"Second necklace I‚Äôve bought from this shop and I‚Äôm just in love with this one than as my first. The Crystal is great quality and the necklace is sturdy. I have received multiple compliments and I think I might be a bit addicted to this shop :D
"
"I‚Äôm delighted with my purchase, it‚Äôs perfect and just as I hoped it would be. I love the adjustable neck strap length which enabled me to get the perfect length.

So beautifully made! The macrame knotting is just beautiful and the tourmaline crystal, beautiful. Adorable little handmade box it was shipped in too. 10/10 xx thank you!! Xx
"
"The item was lovely, and what is even better is the care they put in the packaging... I honestly loved the attention to details and how personal it felt!
"
"I love my ring it's so beautiful! And Stephanie is super helpful and easy to work with, can only give my best recommendations!
"
"The ring is so much prettier than the picture, and the picture is gorgeous.
"
"A beautiful, dainty ring which fits perfectly. Thank you.
"
"Beautifully crafted simple design. Love it!
"
"This ring is sooo stunning and its the most unique ring ive ever bought! my favorite ring to wear! Thank you!
"
"It arrived separate. But still incredibly beautiful. Nothing hot glue can‚Äôt fix. LOL a perfect piece. Thank you!
"
"The ring is absolutely beautiful!!! Extremely happy with my purchase, thank you!!!
"
"Awesome ring, exactly as the picture shows.  I was worried that the crystal ball would come loose from the ring, but it is well secured.  I love it!
"
"Really really beautiful ring. Very well made and of good quality. I am very happy with it. The shipping was incredibly fast. Thank you for being such a friendly and helpful seller :-)
"
"Mooie ring, erg leuk verpakt!
"
"This is my second order from this shop (the first was a bday gift from my partner) and their jewelry is so unique and stunning! Pictures don‚Äôt do this ring justice. The yellow and red colors of the wood are even more vibrant in person. I used a cheap plastic ring sizer that you can get at craft stores or on Amazon, and my sizing was exactly right. Shipping was fast, too. Thank you so much for making such special and high quality wearable art!
"
"I just LOVE my new wooden earstuds. They are modern and chic and sooo beautifully made. I love the natural lines of the wood that makes up the pattern. Lovely packaging and quick delivery! Thank you!
"
"So pretty, and I actually love the fact that it's adjustable so I can wear it on any finger.
"
"Love everything about this!  Thank you!
"
"Beautiful!! Love it so much!
"
"Shape and design very nice. Just I little bit big the ring but my fingers are very small. Russian post was very good.
"
"Gorgeous ring! Thank you very much! It's beautifully crafted!
"
"prachtig, subtiel .. sieraad voor vinger & ogen
"
 
"Ein sehr sch√∂ner Ring, ein ausgesprochen netter und zuvorkommender Kontakt und eine schnelle Lieferung. Alles bestens!!!! Herzlichen Dank.
"
"I wish I could upload a picture to this review. This ring is gorgeous ! I'm very pleased :D
Shipping relatively fast ! 
Thank you
"
"It‚Äôs perfect!
"
"Plus imposante que je ne pensais mais tr√®s jolie qu' en m√™me! Livr√© dans les d√©lais annonc√©
"
"The ring is beautifully made and it fits perfectly. Wear it everyday! Thank you :)
"
"I am so in love with this dainty ring! It‚Äôs the perfect size, super lightweight and comfortable for every day wear, not to mention how beautiful it looks on its own and paired with other rings. I got mine in 4 1/2 and was a bit hesitant if it would fit but it‚Äôs the perfect size!! Absolutely love it and will definitely buy other items from FiEMMA! Thank you :)
"
"Bought this as a pinky ring along with another ring from FiEMMA. Love them both and will definitely be back!
"
"Magnifique. Les bagues sont arriv√©es tr√®s vite !Je recommande.
"
"Wonderful customer service and great quality products! I absolutely love the ring, it‚Äôs the perfect size and very comfortable to wear. Can‚Äôt recommend this shop enough!!
"
"JUST BUY IT LOL! It took a little over a month to receive it and I did grow impatient, but it was well worth the wait. I ordered a size 7 and it was a perfect fit, Amy was so attentive and responded within minutes! I tried to get a good picture to show how beautiful it is!! Pictures don‚Äôt do justice, thank you Amy!
"
"The ring did take a little longer to complete and get to me, but seller was very responsive. Seller made sure I received exactly what I ordered and this ring is beyond beautiful! This is my engagement ring üíç . I wasn‚Äôt allowed to submit multiple photos so I‚Äôm showing a photo of how the ring looks at night üíó
"
"(Writing this on my future husband's account) This ring is absolutely stunning. We are at the beach and it just sparkles like nothing I've seen before. I cried when I saw it in person. Amy did a great job helping us with what we needed, and we will definitely be coming back for a wedding band!
"
"Amy was so easy to work with, and such a big help throughout the entire process! My fianc√© loves her ring! It is beautiful and shines so brightly. Photos do not do it justice whatsoever! Production of the ring took approximately 6 weeks and shipping to Tennessee took approximately 4 days. Also, our dog chewed up the ring box the night of our engagement. Amy is kind enough to send another one so we can have the keepsake. Do not hesitate to order her products!
"
"This ring is absolutely stunning!  I purchased the Tiger‚Äôs eye stone.  I loved it in the picture, but the picture does it no justice.  It is so much prettier in real life.  The band is incredibly smooth on the inside, so makes it very comfortable to wear. I will definitely be making additional purchases!
"
"Gorgeous! I love it!! I ordered my regular size 4.5 but it fits too tight due to the width of the band. Not the sellers fault, I forgot to size up for a wide band.
 I will have it tapped out larger at the Jewelry store because I love it. It‚Äôs beautiful quality
"
"I love it! I wish I knew my ring sizes better, because I wanted this as a pinky ring but it‚Äôs too big. But it fits just fine on a few other fingers! 10/10
"
"I absolutely love it. My husband died 4 months ago and I bought it to replace my engagement and wedding rings. It‚Äôs perfect.
"
"My boyfriend and I absolutely love the rings. I ordered a size too small for my boyfriend so he can‚Äôt wear it on the finger he wanted but mine fits great. Sizes are correct and the packaging was adorable. I received a bonus gift with some earrings as well. The custom writing is small but I promise it‚Äôs there so don‚Äôt freak out like I did thinking it wasn‚Äôt haha. I would recommend to my own friends and family.
"
"Super cute rings and amazing customer service! Seller was incredibly nice with letting me know that it might take longer than expected. Either way, it got here sooner than I thought. Some cute earrings were packed in as a little extra too. Will definitely order from here again ‚ù§Ô∏è
"
"soo impressed with these rings! customer service was amazing as well. bought for me an my boyfriends one year and he loves his too, first ring he‚Äôs ever worn!! Will definitely be ordering again.
"
"These rings are amazing! My boyfriend and I both like them, I had to get an exchange and it was super easy :)
"
"Lovely set.
"
 
"Such a beautiful stacking ring and exactly as pictured. My husband bought it for me to go with my engagement diamond, as my wedding band can sometimes feel a bit flashy to wear with the diamond day-to-day. We got this for me to wear on the other days and it compliments it perfectly! Thank you so much! ‚ú®
"
"I absolutely love Dany‚Äôs work (shop owner/artist). I have purchased most of my gold jewelry from her. Her work is breathtaking!! I usually pair multiple rings together on one finger. This pic has 3 of her pieces in it. The top and bottom rings are specific to this retail posting. The middle, thicker ring, was also made by her. I highly recommend Venexia‚Äôs artwork/jewelry‚Äîyou will always receive QUALITY!
"
"I love my ring, it‚Äôs already bent. But I was able to fix.  Love the look!
"
"I just love my monogram ring.  It‚Äôs beautiful and fits me perfectly.  Thank you!
"
"Love it!  The ring fits perfectly and is just beautiful! Thanks so much!
"
"excatly what i wanted love love love it thanks so much !!!
"
"This ring is beautiful. The sapphires in the rose gold setting are stunning. Lena was wonderful to work with, she‚Äôs on top of her correspondence and even shipped a couple of days early! I‚Äôm so pleased. Love this ring!
"
"Love love love love love. The top photo shows the contrast in direct sunlight, and the bottom is inside. Depending on the lighting the grey will be more pronounced. (The colors seen in the bottom photo are from a stained glass window reflecting nearby!) I absolutely love this ring and am so glad we chose to order from Lena. She answered any and every question I had and the ring took only 3 days to arrive once shipped. After spending weeks looking for a salt and pepper diamond, I was thrilled to come across this listing. If you are even considering a salt and pepper diamond, do not hesitate to inquire about this beauty!
"
"I just received my rings! I was pretty nervous ordering such a high dollar item on the internet but I will buy all of my jewelry from Lena at SevenCarat! The rings are absolutely stunning and everything I had hoped!
"
"I can‚Äôt stop staring at my new engagement ring! Honestly it‚Äôs one of the prettiest rings I‚Äôve ever seen. My fianc√© is very proud of it and I‚Äôm a very happy fianc√©e. He says his favorite part is how much I love it. Lena was amazing and patient answering all our questions about fitting it with wedding bands we had from my grandma. She even gave us a little sneak video to help with our excitement (though to be honest it was all my excitement)!  Shipping was incredibly fast! I hear nothing but compliments when people notice my ring!
"
"I absolutely love my engagement ring my fianc√© and I couldn't be any happier with it. It's very beautiful and elegant totally matches my style 

Thank you ‚ô•Ô∏è
"
"I recieved my ring about a week ago and it was even more beautiful than expected! It's exactly what I was looking for and the craftsmanship was stunning! Mariah is a true artist and it came earlier than I even expected, along with a hand written card thanking me and offering free cleaning, very sweet and personal :) I get compliments every day and not one person didn't know it wasn't a real diamond! I went with CZ stones and 14k white gold because it's what I could afford at the moment and the stones are stunning. I will come back to this shop for any pieces I want in the future! Thank you so so much Sapheena :)
"
"Wowww! My rings are AMAZING ! Seriously worth the wait! Great communication with Mariah and her team. Thank you so much i'm in love with my rings :)
"
"My ring is so beautiful!! More than I could've ever imagined. It's so sparkly and beautifully crafted. Mariah gives excellent customer service and was super attentive. The ring arrived earlier than expected thanks to her üñ§
"
"This headpiece was absolutely perfect. Exactly what I was envisioning for my wedding day. I ended up ordering this very late and the package wasn't scheduled to arrive until after my wedding day, Marina worked with me to make sure it made it on time. Thanks to her, it came the day before the wedding!! So thankful she took the time to help and was incredibly sweet throughout the whole process. Couldn't be happier with this purchase!!
"
"Beautiful! Thank you so much for bringing a touch of glamour into my wedding :)
"
"I wore these flowers for my wedding and they were just perfect! Everybody loved them and they stayed in all night! I'd just recommend ordering them way ahead of time cuz they do take a few weeks to get to you but they're totally worth it!!
"
"Very sparkly! Surprisingly not very heavy. Love these earrings! They shipped within 3 weeks to Aus. Exactly as described. Wore them to my engagement party and got compliments all night!!
"
"LOVE my new set!! It is absolutely beautiful and just perfect. They had to cut my original wedding set off because of a medical emergency (wore it for 19 years- but swelled up really bad due a hemorrhagic stroke). I picked this set because it reminded me of Grandmother's set that was cut in half. Thank you so much for getting it here so fast!! Hopefully, I will have this set just as long as my last set!!üíóüíóüíó
"
"I love it! I bought this ring after needing a replacement for my broken wedding band. I'm usually not a flashy person, but I fell in love with the vintage feel. 

It even looks good on my chubby fingers ü§£ So it's a definite win!
"
"The rings are absolutely beautiful. Everything i dreamed of. So shiny and fit perfectly. ‚ô°‚ô°‚ô°
"
"I love this ring!! The quality is amazing! I wanted an engagement ring that looked very high-quality but was inexpensive and it‚Äôs perfect!
"
"I‚Äôm in love! I was so hesitant to order online but after reading the reviews, I took a chance. This is for our ten year wedding anniversary. This exact ring would‚Äôve cost me triple the price in store. The quality is great, the shipping was quick and I‚Äôve received so many compliments.
"
"I am so happy with my rings!!! I was nervous to order online but am so happy I did!! Great quality and so beautiful!! Thank you so much!!
"
"Absolutely amazing. I was nervous ordering a ring I couldn‚Äôt see first but I‚Äôm completely in love!
"
"In love with this ring! It's more beautiful than the pictures and was delivered earlier than expected. Seller got bsck to my questions very quickly.  Beyond satisfied
"
"I proposed to my [now] fianc√© with this ring, and she absolutely LOVES it. The imitation diamond shines just as much, if not more than a real diamond. Everyone is shocked by how beautiful the ring is, and people can literally see it shimmering from across the room. 
Shipping only took a few days, and I could not be happier.
The ring pictured is size 9.5; 2.15 CT; 14k Rose Gold
"
"BEAUTIFUL. The pictures truly do not do this ring justice AT ALL. I have gotten so many compliments, and can't help but stare at it all day long!!! My fianc√© did a WONDERFUL job in finding this shop and picking out this ring...love love love. Thank you!!!
"
"My fianc√© and I are in love with the ring. üòç
"
"I have always disliked regular engagement rings. They aren't unique, and they all look the same. So, I came to Etsy hoping to find something that suited my personality, and with this amazing store I did. My ring is the most beautiful, classic, unique, and full of life thing I have ever seen. I couldn't be more happy with it! For a reasonable price, I got the exact color and style I always hoped for, and I didn't have to deal with any pushy salesmen or thousands of dollars at a jewelry store. Not only that, but the customer service was exceptional! Fast shipping, simple elegant packaging, and just a fantastic experience. Everyone should be so blessed to get a ring from Zhedora!
"
"Came earlier than expected. The ring is beautiful!
"
"It's honestly even better looking in person. I would leave a photo of it, but I'm trying to write this discreetly with my bf sitting next to me. I have it hidden away and am very excited to eventually propose using said ring.
"
"I wear this as a pinkie ring and I love it.  It's delicate, beautiful, and I get lots of compliments on the ring, especially on its uniqueness.
"
"I love this ring! I'd never purchased fine jewelry online and was somewhat hesitant, but I really wanted this particular ring. I was reassured by the high ratings for the company, and then by Lior's helpful communications and eagerness to do custom modifications if requested. It arrived extremely quickly (a few days) despite COVID and the upcoming holiday season. The appearance and craftsmanship are wonderful.
"
"I just had my third child two months ago and wanted a birthstone ring to represent each one. I chose this one because it looked dainty but good quality. I was so excited for it to come and it hasn‚Äôt disappointed me yet! It shipped on time and arrived before the estimated delivery date. The size seems to fit true and the stones seem securely placed. Very happy with my purchase! Colors are for February, July, then January.
"
"This ring is so pretty! It is amazing quality! I am so happy with this purchase! it is absolutely beautiful!
"
"It goes great with my fathers original wedding band (the gold band) My parents have been married 54 years this June. And my grandmothers original engagement ring. She passed away last July at the age of 99.
"
"I love my ring so much. I got February August February for my three kids. I stare at it all the time especially if I‚Äôm missing them. Thank you for sharing you talent with the world.
"
"This is the most beautiful ring on Etsy!  I absolutely love the way it flows around my finger.  It feels like it was made exactly to fit my hand.  The stone is every bit as pretty as the one in the picture.  PERFECTION!
"
"Ordered after I got the first ring in my hands. This one is beautiful, just like my first one. Great work. Got it safe and on time (got it with reg mail, from Russia to Los Angeles). The ring is great, very interesting, and intricate metal work. I barely feel it when I wear it. The gemstone is natural. The stone color is beautiful green, when sun hits it. Best wishes to the master.

"The ring is so pretty! I'd definitely buy from this shop again!
"
"Gorgeous, well made and just as described.

Olga was great about communication. FYI that I live in CA and it took six weeks to receive the item from Russia.
"
"I love my wood and moss resin ring ! It's sooo adorable! Shipping to the US was as expected (about 3 weeks. ) I will order from this shop again !
"
"I am sooo in love with the ring that I bought from vytvir! It was well worth the wait to get here all the way from the Ukraine. Plus there was a very nice surprise gift that was included with my order! I could not be happier with my purchase.
"
"Thank you so much. Looks‚Äô how is. The engraving is beautiful. Will definitely buy from your small shop again!!
"
"I am absolutely in love with my ring. I‚Äôve also gotten lots of compliments from friends.
"
"Fastest shipping I‚Äôve had in months! Ring was just as pictured, great quality! Seller even threw in a cute freebie. Will definitely buy again in future. Thank you!!
"
"The ring is so pretty! I can‚Äôt wait to give it to my boyfriend. It seems really high quality and the shipping was so fast!
"
"Once again, what a fine ring from giliarto! I love the opal inlay! It goes really nice with the other ring I bought from them. The quality is top notch and I would recommend to anyone looking to buy a nice ring for either themselves or for a lover.
"
"It is so smooth. It slides on super easy and is just all around just as pretty as the picture! Also shipping was incredibly fast
"
"I fell in love with this ring at first sight. It's absolutely lovely although taller than I imagined but it works so well with my band. Shipping was long, made worse by USPS not updating that the ring was shipped but I got a very kind message from the seller reassuring me the ring was actually in transit.
"
"I love this ring!!! If I were to ever get engaged this is the ring I want.  It‚Äôs beautifully made and the sapphires make it!!!
"
"Absolutely gorgeous.  Love it. Definitely recommend.  I have gotten lots of complaints.  Perfect fit.
"
"I absolutely love this ring. The sparkle is tremendous and I get a lot of compliments. Pictures cannot do this justice.
"
"Love this ring especially for a thumb ring beautifully made looks even better on love her jewelry peices I purchased more!! All my fav's ‚ù£Ô∏è
"
"Stunning
"
"Gorgeous quality excellent shipping long
"
"I love this ring!  I bought it large enough to wear on my thumb while I video making my jewelry.  Thank you for the beautiful design!!!
"
"Beautiful ring...dainty, sparkly, perfect...Arrived quickly and securely!  I wanted to update my rings for my 25th anniversary, and mix golds this time around.  I paired this in white gold with my yellow gold emerald cut bezel.  Love my new rings...So happy with how they look together!!
"
"Wow.  I am absolutely BLOWN away by this ring.   My expectations were not high, as the price was extremely reasonable, but I was absolutely SHOCKED and overwhelmed by the beauty.   The rose gold is the PERFECT match to my engagement ring and the sparkle is unreal.  Ramona was so kind and so quick to respond.  My ring was made and shipped in less than 3 weeks.  I am getting married in 50 days and ended up placing another order for the exact same band to do a double layer.    Thank you so much Ramona
"
"Got this band to match my engagement ring and it is absolutely gorgeous! I am obsessed with it, I have no idea how I'm going to wait until my wedding day to wear it. It is exactly what I was looking for and I couldn't be happier with my purchase. The moissanite is beautiful and Ramona was so great to work with!
"
"Honestly after purchasing my ring I don‚Äôt know why I would ever buy from a typical jewelry store again. It is actual perfection and paired so well with my engagement ring! I‚Äôm so in love, thank you!!
"
"I loooooooove my ring! It's my engagement ring and it's SO special. The diamonds and pearl are great quality and it's so sparkly and amazing in person. Best ring choice ever.
"
"Beautiful ring.  Seller was super on top of it, answered any concerns I had quickly and was very polite. The ring was everything I thought it'd be. The pictures are beautiful but seeing it in person is so much more worth it.  Would give 10 stars. Will purchase again in the future without a doubt.
"
"Exactly as pictured. Looks lovely in white gold. Great option for minimalists like us! You don't have to spend big to have a beautiful engagement ring. The pearl is cute. Happy!
"
"This is the most beautiful piece of jewelry I have ever received. Pictures honestly don't do it justice. I love it so much and can't stop staring at it! Thank you!
"
"I love absolutely everything about these rings! They look exactly like the picture, so it's not like I was too surprised when they came in the mail. My fiance and I picked them out because of the unique inlay design. That's really what we were looking for with our rings. And Bryon was so awesome during the whole process. He messaged me to double check the ring sizes, which is just fabulous customer relations. The rings were shipped as soon as they were finished. Definitely worth the wait! I kind of wish I took him up on the engraving offer. Altogether, A+ for sure.
"
"Thank for everything but we are are so happy that we got it and so happy about the rings and everything was done like they say and delivery also.
best regards
Loki and Angela
"
"This is our third pair of wedding rings. Our first which we got married with, started to crack and bend. The second broke in shipping and were not as picture. Finally we stumbled upon these, it may have taken us a couple times to get the right one, but I think we finally did! They are absolutely beautiful! The engraving is exactly what we wanted. They feel like high quality and we hope since they are made of Tungsten they will hold up better than the original bands. Highly recommend!
"
"I was worried that the rings wouldn't arrive in time.  I was worried they wouldn't fit.  I was worried they wouldn't look as nice irl as in the photo.  I worried for nothing.  Beautifully made, perfect fit, perfect day.  Thank you, Bryon!!
"
"I got this ring to wear until my wedding while my wedding band was combined with my engagement ring. I love it! It's beautiful!
"
"I LOVE IT! we‚Äôre on a budget so we couldn‚Äôt spend much on my ring but that didn‚Äôt mean we had to sacrifice beauty!! came on time, fits like it should, and people stay giving me compliments!
"
"I I'm LOVE both my rings so much!! Would give you 10 stars if I could! Fast shipping and even more beautiful in reality! So happy! 

Rekommenderar er alla att handla h√§rifr√•n! Ringarna √§r s√• fina, v√•gade inte ens hoppas p√• h√§lften s√• bra + snabb frakt! B√§ttre √§n b√§st, n√∂jdare √§n n√∂jd! 

THANK YOU!
"
"I LOVE THIS RING. I ordered a size 11 because I needed a 10.25. I took it to the mall and had it resized to 10.25 for $30 on the spot. Worth it. It fits beautifully, the shine is gorgeous, and everyone believes this is a real diamond ring. This is my promise ring. My boyfriend will be getting me a real diamond for our engagement. I can't wait :)

UPDATE: this ring has become my engagement ring for financial purposes. I‚Äôve had it for almost 3 months now and with regular cleaning, it shines so brightly that people believe it‚Äôs worth thousands. To clean at home: baking soda, salt, dish detergent, and hot water. Mix, let jewelry sit for about 10 min, then brush gently with a toothbrush. I promise this ring will not dull with proper cleaning. I absolutely love it.
"
"The service from this seller was phenomenal. I was very skeptical as this is the second time I have purchased from etsy. The first purchase I made was terrible. The shipping took over a month for a single overpriced ring to ship to me. However, the rings I received from this shop were absolutely amazing. The rings were packed twice for safety and came in their own little boxes. The shipping was speedy quick. The rose gold finish is beautiful and the inscription I asked for came out the way I had wanted it. I will definitely be buying from this shop again.
"
"Every beautiful ring! I love it, just gotta go up a size. Fat fingers...
"
"absolutely perfect, I love it so much!! thank you! would highly recommend and will definitely be purchasing from them again in the future ‚ò∫Ô∏è
"
"These rings are beautiful! The seller has amazing customer service as well. The shipping took 3 weeks, but that was no fault of the seller, USPS just takes forever lately. The only issue I have is that the rings are NOT the size I ordered. I ordered an 8 and they are a 7. Now I can't wear them on the finger I initially wanted, so I'm a little bummed about that. Everything except for real solid gold turns me green, so I'll follow the care instructions to a T and update my review if they tarnish and turn me green.
"
"My ring arrived so fast, and it is absolutely beautiful!!! My Fiance and I couldn't be happier. He proposed with a dainty pear diamond ring, but he knew I wanted to design my ring so we chose a Blue Sapphire to represent Greece, where we got engaged. Thanks so much!
"
"My now husband and I picked out this ring together as an engagement ring. I absolutely love this ring and I have gotten so many compliments on it. For the price, it is very good quality! For my wedding band, I got a 2mm white gold band and it goes together so well!
"
"This ring is beautiful. It exceeded my expectations and I couldn‚Äôt be happier with it. Luo was helpful throughout the process and kept in touch. This is the first ring I have bought from him but I will definitely be buying more.
"
"Absolutely love my ring! I get compliments all the time now. I will definitely shop from him again.
"
"I am absolutely OBSESSED with my rose gold ring. I wanted something dainty that I could wear on days I didn‚Äôt want to wear my engagement ring/wedding band. It is PERFECT! I have small fingers, so I was happy to see they could make it in a 4.25. Thank you again!
"
"Absolutely love this delicate ring! I purchased this as a spacer for my engagement ring (from another shop) and wedding band that I purchased from Ferko as well and I couldn‚Äôt be happier with how cohesive everything looks. The quality is amazing and so is Ferko and her team. Item came packaged beautifully and they keep excellent communication throughout the entire process- not to mention that production and shipping are incredibly fast! Thank you so much!
"
"Just as described. I got this ring to go with a new anniversary ring that is rose gold and it‚Äôs large so I wanted a very small band. Figured I‚Äôd stack with my current set for now lol
"
"It‚Äôs perfect. Rose gold color is the same subtle rose as my engagement ring and it fits just beautifully next to it; it‚Äôs almost as if they‚Äôre meant to be together.
"
"I love my engagement ring it is just beautiful and we get sooooo many comments about how stunning and unique it is! Thanks so much!
"
"Beautiful ring and a beyond lovely design! Fianc√© adores it and I'm very happy with the purchase. Don't anticipate ever needing to purchase an engagement ring again, but if I did I would purchase through your company.
"
"Beautiful ring! The picture does not do it justice. My fiance and myself could not be happier with craftsmanship and communication through out the fabricating process to delivery. Cheers!
"
"Absolutely love the ring, never taking it off :) on top of the ring being gorgeous MinimalVS's customer service was outstanding and they helped me with all my questions. Thank you so very much,
Love Collin and Tina
"
"This is so precious!! My only notes is that these rings run small. I wanted this for my middle finger but it‚Äôs a little small at an 11.
"
"Yall! I love this ring! Bought it for myself a while back in rosegold. When a friend saw it and loved it so much, I had to order her a silver for her birthday! So so cute. Great quality for price too.
"
"initially i did have an issue with my purchase of this ring. however, upon speaking with the shop owner, who kindly modified the ring for me, i am very happy with the outcome and it's officially my new favorite piece of jewelry. thank you!
"
"It's gorgeous, fits perfectly, and brings a perfect touch to my wedding day! I can't wait to wear my new monogram ring. It came faster than I expected too!
"
"Absolutely LOVE this ring and her work! This is the second ring I purchased from her! The first was a mother's ring with my two daughter's birthstones which I wear above my wedding band and I just got another one of mine and my husband's birthstones to wear below my wedding band! Her work is beautiful and on time and so reasonable! I could not be happier with this purchase and will definitely be buying again in the future!
"
"Absolutely LOVE this ring! I'm always hesitant buying rings online because  past rings have come larger than advertised. However, Caitlyn has sized her rings truly and perfectly - I was so happy when I wore it the first time!
I've been wearing the ring for about a month now, and it's a sturdy little thing; I've worn it through heavy lifting, landscaping work, and copious amount of laundry and dishes. The stones (June & October birthstones) haven't faded at all in color, and the silver finish remains bright. 
As with any open-gap ring, there's always the risk of it catching on something and bending; when it finally happened to me a week ago, I was able to push the ring back into proper placement (more-or-less) and it still fits great.
"
"It's the cutest!! I got it for my pinky and it looks so nice. It fit me a little big but I improvised.
"
"I could not be more pleased. Ordered this as a gift for myself for Mother‚Äôs Day and I love how dainty and beautiful it is. I got the birthstones of all four of my boys. My firstborns are twins and this dual ring was perfect paired with two singles and then stacked.
"
"This ring. This has become my favorite piece of jewelry that I ALWAYS have with me. If I'm in a place where I cannot wear it, then it's in my pocket. Ever since Wonder Woman (2017) was released, and I saw it half a dozen times, I've been inspired by her empowering role for women. GeekMeABreak did a PHENOMENAL job crafting this ring. The pictures that she posted to advertise her product are EXACTLY what you get! It comes in a package shipped all the way from Greece with a personalized letter! As a new fan of Wonder Woman, I'm STOKED to get to wear a ring on my finger that resembles her crown. And wearing this ring reminds me that I am CAPABLE of greater things that I could ever imagine. I will conquer every dream that is birthed within my heart! Thank you, GeekMeABreak for crafting this ring, flawlessly! ‚ù§Ô∏è much love.
"
"I loved ‚ù§Ô∏è
"
"I LOVE this ring!  It looks exactly like the picture and is beautiful.  It‚Äôs very subtle so it doesn‚Äôt automatically look like fan jewelry.  I wear it every day stacked with my other favorite rings.
"
"Absolutely gorgeous doesn't even begin to cover it. It's flawless!!! My mom loved it (it was a belated mother's day gift). She now shows it off to everyone--random strangers included. Thank you so much!
"
"This ring is GORGEOUS! I was proposed to on top of a mountain while (currently) hiking the Pacific Crest Trail!   Couldn't be happier, thanks so much! - My amazing fiance
"
"Olivia was amazing throughout the process! I needed an engagement ring that wasn't crazy expensive and fit my personality. She messaged me right away and made sure all my questions and concerns were addressed. I received my ring in a timely fashion and couldn't be more happy with the results! The ring is stunning and fits perfectly.
"
"This ring is such a beautiful and incredible ring. The color is just perfection and the maker is just such a wonderful person. I bought my fiance this ring & she adored it. Under abnormal circumstances the ring actually became damaged a few weeks after receiving the ring and Olivia completely blew us away with accommodating our circumstance and remade the ring for us. That was just so incredible of her! Thank you again Olivia. I feel if you are looking for a beautiful gift for someone or even an engagement ring, you should definitely go with rawbyoliviamar. She will not disappoint! I will be purchasing our wedding bands when that time comes with her as well to match. So perfect!
"
"My ring set is so perfect!! I love it so much and can‚Äôt stop telling people about it. Olivia was unbelievably amazing! She created exactly what I asked for and let me be part of her process, which makes the rings even more special to me. Do yourself a favor and go buy all the rings.
"
"This ring is amazing, purchased for a friend's 40th birthday (for her husband). Working with the company on timing and shipment was fantastic.  Communication was amazing.  Highly recommend!!
"
"I will be honest I was very nervous ordering a ring that I never seen in person. It was a risk as my total purchase was over $6k. I said a little prayer and submitted my order lol. I could not believe the ring that I received. It is absolutely more than I could ever image. I been loyal to my jeweler in NJ for over 20years and now have a change of heart. Thank you so so so much!
"
"Let me start by saying my fianc√© and I could not find an engagement ring that we absolutely loved. All of the rings looked the same. Until I saw this ring. I was skeptical because I couldn‚Äôt see it in person. I just loved it so much I took the chance. There is a 30 day return policy if I did not like it. This ring is absolutely GORGEOUS!!! I can‚Äôt stop looking at it. It surpassed all of my expectations. I love that it was made for me  specifically. Rose gold which I love and engaged as well. The ring is worth 2x what we paid for it. The workmanship is impeccable. Don‚Äôt hesitate to order this ring if you love it!!
"
"BEAUTIFUL BEAUTIFUL RING! The clarity of the ring is WOW! Definitely looks way better up close. Dalia was very patient and answered all my questions. I live in California so when it came to the shipment it was way sooner then we thought! I will definitely do more business with her in the future. You will not be disappointed in your purchase.
"
"SAVE YOUR MONEY! I'm so disappointed with this purchase. 
I love wearing jewelry, and I always have trouble finding cute rings. I like delicate, not bulky, and I found this ring on etsy and it was PERFECT! Exactly what I wanted. I decided it would be fun that since my sister and I have close birthdays, to get us each a ring with our initials! It's been about 3 months now, I tried it on about 5 times, but due to COVID I haven't had anywhere to be or any reason to wear cute jewelry. This past weekend (valentine's day) I was so excited to finally have a reason to wear my ring! It was so cute and I was obsessed! However, within the first 30 minutes of me wearing it, my initials just broke off the ring as I was sitting in the car on the way to dinner.
SOOOO from this I hope you save your money and buy something with good quality.
"
"The cutest and most beautiful dainty ring ever! Took a long time to get here (as was expected) but it was well worth the wait! I love it so much. The gorgeous packaging and high quality exceeded my expectations.
"
"Love my new ring!  I‚Äôve been searching for a ring like this and it‚Äôs perfect!
"
"I absolutely love them! They fit perfectly and are so adorable! They stack perfectly together and look great stacked with other rings too! I get compliments on them all the time! Beyond happy with them!‚ù§Ô∏è
"
"I fell in love with this ring at first sight. It's absolutely lovely although taller than I imagined but it works so well with my band. Shipping was long, made worse by USPS not updating that the ring was shipped but I got a very kind message from the seller reassuring me the ring was actually in transit.
"
"I love this ring!!! If I were to ever get engaged this is the ring I want.  It‚Äôs beautifully made and the sapphires make it!!!
"
"Absolutely gorgeous.  Love it. Definitely recommend.  I have gotten lots of complaints.  Perfect fit.
"
"I absolutely love this ring. The sparkle is tremendous and I get a lot of compliments. Pictures cannot do this justice.
"
"We bought a pair of these for our wedding bands. They are even more beautiful in person-the pictures don‚Äôt do them justice! Each came in their own little wooden box and with a black silicon band in our sizes. We ordered the ring sizer ahead of time as well so the fit would be identical and let me tell ya-they fit PRECISELY. We love our bands and the seller was exquisitely professional and timely with our questions, our order, and shipping. 10/10 would recommend this shop and these rings!
"
"This ring is gorgeous! I‚Äôm very happy with it and can‚Äôt wait to give it to my fianc√©. The band isn‚Äôt all smooth and I‚Äôm hoping he doesn‚Äôt scratch it. Shipping was very fast!
"
"This ring is so beautiful. My fianc√© loves it! The quality is amazing. It is nice and heavy. Plus the silicone ring was exactly what my fianc√© wanted for work. We needed to exchange sizes, but this shop made it so easy and stress free. I am so thankful for their incredible customer service.
"
"This shop is amazing. I had to make a return and exchange and they made it so fast and easy. I love how before you exchange your ring they first send you the replacement before you send back your ring so you aren‚Äôt left with no ring to wear. Shipping was incredibly fast. They also reply back super quick to your messages. My fianc√© loves his ring! Highly recommend this seller!
"
"I wish I could give this a million stars. Howl‚Äôs Moving Castle is my #1 comfort film. This ring was a birthday gift to myself to help keep a bit of light with me at all times when I‚Äôm feeling low. Stephenie is the kindest soul and helped me extensively with my sizing issues which were my fault alone. The ring itself is so beautiful and well-made. I will treasure this forever.
"
"The ring is so pretty ! She was very attentive and answered all my questions ü•∞ü•∞ü•∞ it‚Äôs exactly like the picture. I got a July faceted ring in the size 6 3/4 and it‚Äôs abit big but I don‚Äôt mind !
"
"just got it today and i‚Äôm so amazed at the quality omg so worth the wait! I got the aquamarine stone and it‚Äôs absolutely beautiful in the sun ü•∫ seller is also the greatest at answering all my questions and concerns! here‚Äôs a little pic with the ring and the best boi modeling for the best howl ring ü•∞ would definitely buy from her again <3
"
"this ring is beautiful. i can‚Äôt even describe the excitement i had once i opened the little ring box. it‚Äôs incredibly made well and i might have to save up to buy another ring from this brand. it‚Äôs absolutely gorgeous.
"
"Yelena was so patient with me and offered a fantastic payment plan so I could afford a beautiful ring for my amazing girlfriend on my own time. The ring is stunning and my now-fiancee is so happy with it, and says it's absolutely perfect. Yelena even allowed me to add expedited shipping so the ring arrived just in time. The ringbox even came with a little light to accentuate the sparkle, which was a wonderful touch.
"
"Yelena was so patient and communicated with me with every question and request when creating a custom ring for me. I am just stunned with how incredible my ring turned out. It‚Äôs absolutely beautiful. It fits perfectly and turned out better than I imagined! She used the raw diamond I was proposed to with and created the most beautiful wedding ring with it. She included me in the design process and kept me updated throughout. I am so happy with my ring. It‚Äôs perfect.
"
"I can't find enough kind words to express my feelings about how cared for I felt throughout the entire process! The end result is incredible. Several people have already expressed their ""ring envy"" and I don't blame them. Yelena deserves all the credit and I will be singing her praises to the end of time!
"
"Absolutely in love with this custom band that Yelena designed. She used the lace trim on my veil to design the beautiful wedding band that fits perfectly with my engagement ring.
"
"absolutely love this ring! a little lighter than i expected but it still gives me the unique look that i wanted. would definitely recommend!
"
"Excellent quality nephrite Jade ring. Accurate sizing so it fits perfectly. The jade has a lovely translucency to it. Took a while to arrive in the UK (no doubt due to extra Covid restrictions in transit) but worth the wait. I love it and would recommend highly.
"
"Beautiful ring I love it so much already I was so scared because I accidentally got a 6 instead of my normal 5 but it actually fits perfectly thank you amazing service will order again!
"
"Its perfect and arrived on time.I like this jade ring alot.CP
"
"This ring was more then I could have ever asked for. My future husband bought this for me as my engagement ring. I still havent stopped staring at it. It is absolutely breath taking. It's so well hand crafe, detailed and unique. It fits perfect and it georgous, I haven't stopped getting compliments on it.  Thank you for making my perfect engagment ring.
"
"I cannot express how happy I am with this ring! I wish I was a better photographer cause it's even more beautiful in real life. Thank you! Thank you! Thank you! Prettiest thing I own.
"
"This ring is beyond amazing! Husband got it for me as a new wedding ring and I couldn't be happier. I was a little nervous because I thought it was going to be bulky but it's not at all! It's super comfortable, like nothing is there!
"
"Gorgeous, gorgeous ring w/ wonderful communication.  I asked for a custom stone (a labradorite) and was sent pictures so I could choose the exact stone I wanted.  With such a thick ring, I was worried it would feel bulky to wear, but it is very light and comfortable.  The design is phenomenal.  I'll definitely be back!  Thanks so much!!!
"
"It shipped on time and the jeweler was able to expedite the process to accommodate my proposal deadline. The jeweler was very open in communication and very helpful answering questions. I would absolutely do business with this shop again.

As for the ring. My now fiancee describes it as delicate looking, while also feeling sturdy and solid without being clunky. I loved the profile view of the ring, and it may even look better in person than in the pictures. We are both a big fan of the ring and think it a beautiful. In the end, it got her to say ""Yes"", and that's what really matters.
"
"Wow. My son wanted to get engaged after he graduated from Navy Boot Camp. I mean right then. He called me during Boot Camp and said he needed a ring with a Morganite in Rosegold and vintage. I had three weeks to find and purchase and size!  I found this ring with a Moisanite, requested it be changed to a morganite.  I looked at the website and it said five weeks were needed to make the ring.  I wrote the shop owner told him the story and he had it made for me within a two week timeframe and sent to me. It arrived on time it was perfect it was beautiful and mostly it was exactly what she wanted. They both loved it. She gets compliments on it daily.A big thank you to the jeweler. Thank you thank you!
"
"This ring is absolutely gorgeous. I wish I could give this more than five stars! I can't keep my eyes off it, it's so perfect. One of my newly engaged friends actually said this ring is so beautiful that it made her like her ring less. 100% would recommend GNG Jewel to all of my friends!
"
"This ring looks even better in person! Photos don't do it justice. Gene was great to work with and I absolutely love my new ring!
"
"The ring is absolutely stunning. It's so beautiful and dainty. Jabby even replaced two of the diamonds with two different shades of tourmaline to really make it my own.
"
"This was our engagement ring, it was absolutely flawless. She loved it so much and of course said yes!!!

"Ring was shipped exactly (maybe a little earlier) as expected. Made it here in great condition. The ring itself was small and dainty. Everything about it is great. Would highly recommend buying from Jabby/LoveRingsDesign.

I had quiet a few questions/wants that Jabby and I talked through after ordering. Jabby helped every step of the way and even took a video for me to show how the different rings looked!
"
"I ordered this ring in white gold with a slight alteration to close the gap between the center diamonds. The final product is gorgeous, and I absolutely love it. Jabby was extremely easy to work with, and she made sure I loved the final design. I would 100% recommend this ring and this shop!
"
"I cannot say enough about how GORGEOUS my ring is. Not only is it flawless and unique, but it is clearly carefully made with so much love. Working with this seller is a DREAM! I‚Äôm over the moon and can‚Äôt wait to add to this piece and many more. ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
"
"I am absolutely in love with my ring! Derick made the purchasing experience so easy. I was a little hesitant to buy online but after reading the reviews I was sold. The ring came in amazing packaging and you can tell Derick puts a lot of thought in not only the craftsmanship of his rings but on his customers. I am constantly getting complimented on my ring!
"
"Months of international engagement conspiracy culminating with Alex proposing with the custom made morganite & diamond ring (thanks HelloRing!!!!)...and Carolina saying ""Yes!""
"
"Derick has curved the ring for my fiancee to the level best and the the happiness he gives with his work is remarkable and a blessing truly...I am so happy to be honest not only Derick made the best of ring but also gave prompt replies and a faster shipping surprising me . I look forward to buy jewelries from him in future again.....Cheers
"
"Brought 3 rings. This one, the forget me not, and the moss. All beautiful and true to size! Love wearing rings on my thumbs and middle fingers so they fit perfect! Would definitely order again!
"
"Super cute! Didn't realize How small my guages were LOL. BUT I still like them! I thought I knew my guage but this are a tad bit big and can not get them in BUT thats ok!! I am going to keep on trying to get them in LOL
"
"I have been eye balling this store for a solid while now. Especially with covid, I was nervous about shipping times seeing as it's based out of the country. It was about 3 weeks, but so so so worth the wait. Customer service is top notch! I had no complaints, and didn't reach out, but was kept alerted to every single update. Shipping estimate, tracking number, everything I received an email. These plugs are incredibly beautiful, perfect inch and a half. So unique and dainty and feminine! ADORABLE! 10000/10 recommend. Will 100% be a return customer!
"
"i bought these for prom and i love them!! they‚Äôre high quality and absolutely gorgeous. i‚Äôm a size 00g so i was afraid that the crystals would be too closely packed to look good, but i took the chance on buying them and i‚Äôm so glad i did! shipping was fast and the packaging was really nice. they even included how to care for the plugs and a warning that water might damage them ! i don‚Äôt have a good picture of the plugs, but even a good picture could never show how gorgeous these plugs are in person!
"
"Purchased this ring to propose to my now fiance and she absolutely loves it. The pictures just don't do it justice. It is beautiful! Will was very responsive and the order shipped a month early! 10/10 would order again.
"
"Beautiful ring, pictures don‚Äôt do it justice. My partner was thrilled with it and so was I. Seller was also very communicative and shipped it extremely fast. Highly recommended!
"
"Thank you so much! The ring is exactly as advertised and we couldn't be happier. I added the rush order and the ring was complete within 7 or 8 business days just as specified.
"
"Most beautiful thing I have ever seen. Thank you so much!
"
"This ring is Beautiful with the rose in it...
Rose have a special meaning to us :)

Love this ring... and as soon as i gave it she fell in love with it too 5/5
"
"I got This ring as a Promise ring for My girlfriend, and It is absolutly Gorgeous!  She loved it, as well as the ear rings.   I couldn't be more satisfied.
"
"I got my rose ring in the mail today and I love it so much. It fits perfectly and it‚Äôs just what I wanted. I can‚Äôt wait to wear it everyday!
"
"Beautiful!! It looks better than I ever could have expected! My partner adores it :')
"
"Obviously an engagement ring is a big decision and I really never thought I'd buy one off of Etsy.  I first considered a lab grown diamond but those are still very expensive.  So I did some looking and found moissanite.  Just by chance I searched on Etsy and came across this listing.  The pictures were beautiful and the seller very helpful and responsive.  I decided to buy it and it's every bit as beautiful in person as it is online.  It sparkles, it is cut beautifully and the white gold band is flawless.  The size is perfect and we really love it.  The ring box was very classy, simple and beautiful.  It's amazing quality with incredible craftsmanship and we're both very happy with it.  It arrived in the time the seller stated and everything went very smoothly.
"
"It's absolutely perfect and so so much better than I ever expected from the pictures. My fianc√© adores it! I couldn't be happier! It looks amazing and she's gotten so many compliments on it as have I. Thank you for making this so perfect! :) 10/10 would recommend
"
"What can I say about this ring... it is absolutely, drop dead gorgeous! The work and time that go into this ring clearly shows. The stone is clear and vibrant, the band is solid, this is just amazing work. The ONLY thing I have to say, is expect the actual shipping of this item to be about week longer than what is said on the profile page. I ordered the band in Silver, and the processing time is supposed to take ABOUT 10 business days. I order the ring on the 10/2 and received on 10/25. However, with all that being said... the customer service was prompt and courteous both Angela and Dymitri are polite and timely and have BEAUTIFUL products! If I had another choice I would still choose Bihls. Thank you so much!!
"
"Ring is everything she wanted. The band fit perfectly and the stone has amazing shape. The light makes the ring sparkle and shine with an enchanting glow. Thank you Bihls for making our moment special!
"
"First things first: she said yes! Secondly, the ring was amazing! Well built, sturdy, clean cut, beautiful. The pictures don't do it justice! I saw the pictures thought ""this is the ring I want!"" But when I got it, when I held it in person, I knew: ""This is the ring I need!""
"
"Photos don't do it justice! Absolutely beautiful, could not be happier. Arrived quicker than promised as well... if only there were more stars to give!
"
"I love this ring! I bought it as a stand in for my wedding ring while pregnant because my hands have swollen a bit. It‚Äôs so beautiful and dainty!
"
"Love my flower ring!!! This is not my first order. Love her jewelry!!
"
"The ring is beautiful and fits comfortably.  The sizing was exact.  The shop is very nice to do business with!  Shipping was fast.
"
"The craftsmanship is outstanding, enjoy the simplicity that only enhances the beauty of the ring. So thankful to TwoFeathersNY for  being professional and friendly!
"
"Beautiful ring, I can't wait to wear it
"
 
"Really beautiful! Came with certification papers, and a nice box! Very pleased! My wife will love this!
"
"OBSESSED IS AN UNDERSTATEMENT!!!! I am seriously in heaven. My original wedding ring was a moissanite white gold  from a different Etsy seller and no longer fit me. I decided on getting a replacement ring in gold. I searched for hours for the right size, shape, and quality. I checked my ring size with the measured and it was exactly 6.25, and David messaged me to confirm the size. It fits PERFECT! Shipping was fast for a hand made item, it was packaged nicely, and came with some beautiful additions. I selected the yellow gold, 2ct simulated diamond. I will definitely be back for more. THANK YOU :)
"
"Pictures will never do this piece of jewelry justice! It is absolutely gorgeous! I‚Äôm obsessed with it! It‚Äôs everything I hoped it would be. I‚Äôve received so many compliments in the short period I‚Äôve had it. Also I was super happy when I received notification that it had shipped before the estimated time!
"
"This ring is absolutely beautiful! It is a little bit larger than I had expected but I‚Äôm still in love with it. Shipping took a while but I ended up asking the seller and they advised that there was an issue when making the ring so they had to wait on new supplies to come in. Overall this is a beautiful piece ‚ù§Ô∏è
"
"Absolutely love my ring!! the quality is fantastic, and exceeded my expectations. It looks just like the photos and goes perfectly next to my diamond engagement ring. They sent me photos of my exact ring before shipping to make sure I was happy with it! I am extremely pleased with this purchase!
"
"This ring is even more stunning in person. It is so sparkly, well made and dainty. Brijesh is wonderful to work with and you can tell really cares about the customer as well as the quality of the work. I was looking for stackable rings to go with my engagement ring and I ordered the 2.5MM and 2.0MM size. These are perfect and I am happy I found this shop.  Thank you!!!
"
"Obsessed is an understatement!!! This ring is perfect next to my 1ct diamond. I was skeptical to get a moissanite wedding band next to my real diamond on my engagement ring, but you can‚Äôt tell at all! Processing and shipment was super fast. Would definitely recommend this product/shop!
"
"This ring is EVERYTHING I wanted and more. The only jewelry I wear daily is my engagement ring. I was looking for something dainty and elegant and this ring fit the bill. If you‚Äôre a minimalist when it comes to jewelry this ring is it! üòç
"
"I‚Äôm in love! I was so hesitant to order online but after reading the reviews, I took a chance. This is for our ten year wedding anniversary. This exact ring would‚Äôve cost me triple the price in store. The quality is great, the shipping was quick and I‚Äôve received so many compliments.
"
"I am so happy with my rings!!! I was nervous to order online but am so happy I did!! Great quality and so beautiful!! Thank you so much!!
"
"Absolutely amazing. I was nervous ordering a ring I couldn‚Äôt see first but I‚Äôm completely in love!
"
"In love with this ring! It's more beautiful than the pictures and was delivered earlier than expected. Seller got bsck to my questions very quickly.  Beyond satisfied
"
"I can't get over how gorgeous this ring is.  Photos do not do it justice. It's simple, classic, and elegant.

"The ring is so beautiful I'm in love
"
"Absolutely stunning piece of jewelry!  This ring exceeded my expectations and I will definitely be looking to order more from this shop.
"
"I LOVE this ring! It's gorgeous - the flowers inside look beautiful. Thank you!
"
"Got these as part of my gifts for my bridesmaids to wear with their dresses. Loved them. Exactly what I wanted! They loved them too!
"
"These small flowers were so pretty and arrived in time.
"
"So so pretty! I love how dainty the flowers are‚Äîthey're small and subtle, which I LOVE the look of. 100% recommend! <3
"
"Jason, Received my ring today and I absolutely love it!  The ring with black patina is very cool, (better looking in person).  The size was perfect. It has become my new wedding band. I will definitely show it to my friends. Thanks again,  Bill
"
"OMG ! This coin ring from CoinCraftersShop is a Masterpiece.  I strongly recommend  black powder coat option.  It makes the ring even more stunning.  Most importantly, CoinCrafters made and delivered the ring on spec and on schedule and keep me informed and stayed in contact. Great shop!  I will most definitely want to buy more from here.
"
"You crafted this silver dollar ring for my grandfather who I love beyond anything in this world. I explained to you how he got his name ""silver dollar"" and his time serving in WWII, hair Purple Heart and many more accolades. I am absolutely floored and you brought me to tears of sheer joy that not only did this ring turn out beyond stunning, you went that extra mile and wrote to him specifically thanking him for his service and sacrifices. Thank you from the bottom of my heart for this. He's 91 years young and is going to be just as floored when he receives this wonderful momento of not only my gratuity for him but from your company as well.

Thank you for your expedient service and your beyond professionalism by going above and beyond. I am truly humbled and so grateful. 

Thank you again!!!!!!! ‚ù§Ô∏èüá∫üá∏
"
"I Love-Love-Love It!!!

The Fit is perfect and true to size.
Great workmanship with a very detailed clean finish.
GREAT PRICE! Well worth the money. Shipped very fast.

Exceeded all my expectations.

Thank You So Much :)
"
"Love my ring, received in amazing time. slight discoloration on finger but was just antiquing. have received many compliments. would order from this shop again.
"
"WOW - i am a bit stunned with how beautiful this piece of sculpture is :) it fits PERFECTLY and i think i may never take it off! just astonishing, and i love how it looks just like my favourite New Zealand tree, the native pohutukawa. will DEFINITELY be purchasing from you again, thank you!!!
"
"Beautiful ring! I bought the shiny version which isn't pictured, it's literally just a shiny rendition. Absolutely love it!
"
"I am in love with my ring. You'd think for it's size it'd be a bit bulky, but it's so comfortable sometimes I forget I have it on. Incredible detail and it fits to size. I'll definitely be buying from Vladimir again! Thank you!!!
"
"Once again, love by Oh Kuol went above and beyond!! I purchased a custom band from them to go with my engagement ring (also from them!) a few weeks ago. When I saw the first piece, I knew I had to get another to stack on either side of my engagement ring. Vi was once again incredibly responsive and got my custom piece completed very fast! I couldn‚Äôt be happier and can‚Äôt wait to rock my pieces after my wedding!! Highly, highly recommended!!
"
"I am absolutely thrilled with my beautiful ring! Communication was excellent and very quick. The ring set is absolutely stunning and exceeded my expectations. Thank you so much. I would definitely recommend.
"
"My fianc√© purchased my engagement ring from this Etsy shop. I found the band I wanted to sit underneath the engagement ring and decided to contact the same shop so they‚Äôd fit perfectly. I am OBSESSED with this custom ring! From step one of contacting this shop to the final receipt of the product, the experience was amazing and professional! They responded quickly to any and all questions that I had. They sent 3D images of what the ring would look like so I could confirm it was what I wanted. The ring was produced and delivered in under two weeks. The quality is gorgeous and it is EXACTLY what I asked for. I love this ring and I love this shop, 10/10; highly recommend!!
"
"Ordered a custom halo ring and was really impressed by the communication from Vi and the quick shipping. The teal sapphire gemstone looks fantastic - different colors come through depending on the lighting. The pictures Vi sent of the gemstones options were helpful and my fiance√© was able to pick the gemstone that she liked, and I ultimately finalized the settings. She loves it and keeps looking at it during the trip. She thought it was a bit tight at first but we got engaged at a very hot climate, and the ring is fitting better now. Overall, great experience.
"
"Beautiful craftsmanship!  Thank you for great purchasing experience!
"
"I have several of Galyna's rings. They are all so beautiful and beautifully made.  I also now have a really pretty pair of her earrings.  I can't say enough how happy I am with my purchases.
"
"The ring is stunning and the care taken to package it came straight from the heart. Thank you!!
"
"These are spectacular I love love love them high quality and colors are vibrant and I‚Äôm always surprised with her quality and colors are so beautiful‚Äîalso they are not too heavy for my ears and I‚Äôm older and my ears pull down and these work!  Durability appears to be there as well‚ÄîI just received all of her earrings so hoping they will last and I‚Äôm very careful with these kinds of earrings‚Äîso very happy with purchase always and ordered three more because these are my outfits working on zoom all the time!
"
"Thank you Mary! And Koten Studios! I ordered this back drop necklace in silver and it is absolutely stunning! I will be wearing it New Year's Eve with a V backed black dress for a Phantom of the Opera theme.  Perfect! And on top of that, I requested matching earrings which were made just for me and they came today. Wow! Very fast on the shipping! If you are thinking of purchasing anything from this amazing artist,  do it.  You will not be disappointed!  If I could fill in more stars, I would!

"Wore these 1 day, and had so many compliments on them. Love these!
"
"These are SO beautiful!! They are dainty but I have long, thick, curly hair and you can still see them when my hair is down! The color is gorgeous!!
"
"Incredibly sexy and gorgeous. It is delicate and I keep worrying I‚Äôm going to break it but I love it.
"
"My fiancee ordered my ring from Lee and it is absolutely beautiful. I am head over heels in love with it. It's a very pale blush pink morganite and it sparkles like crazy! The wedding band it came with is absolutely gorgeous and unique as well. I'm looking forward to the day I can wear them together. If you are at all on the fence about ordering from Lee don't be! You won't regret it. His communication was great, the quality of his craftsmanship is breathtaking..I will be ordering from him from now on.
"
"These rings are so lovely! The engagement ring especially looks dainty and delicate, but it stands up to daily wear. The setting is a bit high but hasn‚Äôt been a problem. Sizing feels accurate enough.

This set is affordable without sacrificing on looks/quality (as far as my untrained eye can see - gemstone info not included and would need to get appraised).

Communication with the seller is easy, Lee responds promptly and is very nice. Even with a rush order I was concerned about receiving the shipment on time before we left for vacation, and Lee was understanding and reassuring. They shipped via USPS, which I liked since they deliver to my building on weekends. The rings arrived about 18 days (13 business days) after ordering.

Would recommend! Thank you for the beautiful rings!
"
"Beyond obsessed with my ring! The gem matches so nicely with the rose gold, and it sparkles like you wouldn't believe. The seller was excellent in communication and the shipping was incredibly fast! Ive gotten so many compliments on it in just 2 days! Love everything about this ring! Would most definitely recommend!
"
"This process was amazing from start to finish. The ring looks exactly as illustrated in the picture. The communication from start to finish was perfect! I never waited longer than 5hrs for a reply and that is important when you are spazzing out about shipping!!! The ring shipped and arrived within three days as promised, and I was able to get the package and surprise my fianc√© before we left on our trip!  The ring is beautiful and she loves it. I would definitely recommend this seller to all of my friends and family looking to buy the perfect ring. Thanks for this moment special.
"
"Absolutely beautiful- exactly what I wanted for my wedding band. Cannot beat this unbelievable price either. I am looking forward to purchasing another band so I can stack it alongside this band and my engagement ring. Stunning- I'm so happy!
"
"I love my two diamond bands....I stacked them on either side of my other ring and it is perfect. Even better than I imagined! I love them! ü•∞
"
"Gorgeous ring! Have searched for years to find the perfect eternity band to go with my engagement ring. Just the right amount of bling.

I will certainly be back!
"
"Beautiful ring that I will wear in a few months as my wedding band.  I wanted a subtle, but feminine, wedding band with a bit of glimmer and this was a perfect selection.  The quality is wonderful and it looks very nice and natural next to my plain, 18K White Gold band.  
Zina responded immediately to my questions and the shipment was speedy.  Ring was very protected in shipping material in came in a lovely gift box.
"
"I cannot say enough good things about the ring. It‚Äôs absolutely unique and beautiful. My fianc√© absolutely loves it! It will be his wedding ring. We first ordered the free sizer from the shop and ordered the ring according to sizer. The ring fits perfectly and is amazing quality. The shipping was super fast to the United States. Even with covid delays it got here early. I‚Äôm so happy we came across this ring, my fianc√© can‚Äôt wait to wear it. For reference, We got the 5mm in Rose Gold.
"
"The ring is so beautiful! I bought it for my wedding. The communication was great and all my questions regarding the size was answered quickly. I went to the juwelery to measure the size and tested other rings. I highly recommend this because the size was much bigger in the end than the size I measured myself. And the ring fits perfect.
"
"My husband and I absolutely love this ring! We ordered this ring while everything was shut down, so we weren‚Äôt able to check his ring size and so we had to try to size his ring at home.. well we thought we figured out his ring size and when we got the ring, it was too big. Reut was patient enough to let us wait until stores opened to get the correct ring size once we did, I instantly messaged Reut. He gave me awesome instructions on how to send it back to resize it. We just got the ring back and it‚Äôs PERFECT!!! Thank you so much Reut!!! I would give you more than 5 stars if I could.
"
"The ring is perfect! We ordered it for my partner because we wanted a unique set of rings that went together. My own ring is a rough diamond on a rose gold band and so this rough faceted/rose gold ring complimented my own nicely. It fits wonderfully, arrived quickly, and I couldn't recommend this shop more. Great customer service and great quality product!
"
"I am absolutely OBSESSED with my rose gold ring. I wanted something dainty that I could wear on days I didn‚Äôt want to wear my engagement ring/wedding band. It is PERFECT! I have small fingers, so I was happy to see they could make it in a 4.25. Thank you again!
"
"Absolutely love this delicate ring! I purchased this as a spacer for my engagement ring (from another shop) and wedding band that I purchased from Ferko as well and I couldn‚Äôt be happier with how cohesive everything looks. The quality is amazing and so is Ferko and her team. Item came packaged beautifully and they keep excellent communication throughout the entire process- not to mention that production and shipping are incredibly fast! Thank you so much!
"
"Just as described. I got this ring to go with a new anniversary ring that is rose gold and it‚Äôs large so I wanted a very small band. Figured I‚Äôd stack with my current set for now lol
"
"It‚Äôs perfect. Rose gold color is the same subtle rose as my engagement ring and it fits just beautifully next to it; it‚Äôs almost as if they‚Äôre meant to be together.
"
"This ring is beautiful. It fits perfectly and is very sparkly. The craftsmanship is truly stunning. Shipping was fastened took way less time than expected. I love my ring and always get tons of compliments on it!
"
"This ring is absolutely gorgeous! I can‚Äôt stop looking at it. Very unique. Shipped very quickly and was prepared ahead of time. Very excited to wear this for the rest of my life!
"
"This ring is beautiful, the seller is responsive, professional. and prompt. I received my ring well before the estimated time.
"
"Absolutely beautiful ring! I'm so pleased with it. I can't stop looking at it. shipping was  prompt! It got here sooner than I expected. I would highly recommend this shop!
"
"Love this ring! My fianc√© is not a jewelry guy AT ALL. Every time we talked about getting him a ring he would talk about how he just doesn‚Äôt like jewelry and isn‚Äôt a ‚Äúring‚Äù guy. So when we found these I was surprised he liked them enough to settle on it. Well I‚Äôm glad he did because he loves and I love it and it goes perfect with our lifestyle, theme and matches my rose gold ring.
"
"Couldn‚Äôt have asked for a more handsome anniversary ring for my husband! I originally forgot to fill out that I wanted it engraved/burned, contacted the seller, and he got back to me immediately and still made it happen! I am so thankful for it, and my husband couldn‚Äôt be happier! Thank you!
"
"Highly recommended this shop and their products. I had to exchange my ring for a different size. This couldn‚Äôt have been easier. The ring is beautiful and looks just like the pictures.
"
"I finally gave my wife her ring on our one year wedding anniversary ! It‚Äôs so beautiful it fits perfect ü§© she absolutely loves it the delivery process was so fast. Thanks soo much
"
"Recommended
"
"The ring is beautiful, but unfortunately it turns my finger green whenever I wear it, which makes me wonder what it truly is made out of. I will probably have to put clear nail polish on the inside in order to be able to wear it.
"
"This ring is lovely. I understand why it took longer for delivery with events in the world. I'll buy again from this shop
"
"Better than the picture!  Beautiful! Just know shipping takes a while cause it's coming from India.
"
"Most beautiful ring I ever did see. Looks amazing on my woman and she's over the moon with it. Amazing amazing amazing
"
"I absolutely love my ring!! Beautifully made and exactly as shown in the picture, I‚Äôve had so many compliments since I received it and would definitely recommend this seller to anyone looking for a quality hand crafted ring :)

"Words do no justice for the beauty of this ring and the responsiveness of Amy during the entire process (especially during a pandemic!)

In the beginning, Amy took time to help ensure I ordered the proper size. (Ordering a new ring during a Pandemic without any idea of your new post-children ring size could be problematic üòÇ). I‚Äôm thankful for Amy‚Äôs guidance because I originally placed an order for what would have been a wrong size

Amy‚Äôs communication through the end - final photos of the ring before shipping and updates during pandemic mail delays - was always much appreciated. It took a little longer than normal because of the USPS delays once in the US, but the extra time was well worth the wait!

I was nervous to order a ring online, a first for me. But THIS RING! It‚Äôs beautiful. I‚Äôll be back for more! Thank you so much!
"
"Amy provided a splendid ring which looks just as great in real life as in the preview.
She was responsive and friendly throughout the waiting period from when I placed the order to when it was dispatched.

When my then-girlfriend, now-fiancee started to look for engagement ring-ideas to recommend me and coincidentally found Amy herself (not knowing that I had already made the arrangements and was about to propose), Amy was helpful in cooperating to string my girlfriend along. The result was that my girlfriend thought I was merely at the stage of looking for a ring and discussing this with Amy, and so the proposal came as a complete surprise!

I can't recommend Amy enough!
"
"Beautiful sterling ring, definitely real sterling. However size up because I always order the same size rings and this ran way too small to even fit on my finger! Had to give it away as a gift, was bummed. But beautiful ring! Looks just like the photos.
"
"Love this ring!! Perfect for what I was wanting.
"
"I love the simple beauty of my new ring
"
"Awesome awesome and more awesome; love this ring!
"
"Very pretty ring, just like the picture. Came quickly to france! I love it and will definitely buy again from this seller :)

"Much prettier than picture. Arrived in 3 weeks from India even with COVID, beautifully packed. Keeping this one for me, ordered more for presents

"I recieved my ring about a week ago and it was even more beautiful than expected! It's exactly what I was looking for and the craftsmanship was stunning! Mariah is a true artist and it came earlier than I even expected, along with a hand written card thanking me and offering free cleaning, very sweet and personal :) I get compliments every day and not one person didn't know it wasn't a real diamond! I went with CZ stones and 14k white gold because it's what I could afford at the moment and the stones are stunning. I will come back to this shop for any pieces I want in the future! Thank you so so much Sapheena :)
"
"Wowww! My rings are AMAZING ! Seriously worth the wait! Great communication with Mariah and her team. Thank you so much i'm in love with my rings :)

"My ring is so beautiful!! More than I could've ever imagined. It's so sparkly and beautifully crafted. Mariah gives excellent customer service and was super attentive. The ring arrived earlier than expected thanks to her üñ§
"
"There really are no words to do justice for the beauty and quality of work from Mara and her pieces.  I‚Äôve received so many compliments on its uniqueness, beauty and wonder. I could not have dreamed of a more perfect anniversary present.  Secondly, Mara was a dream to work with and I can‚Äôt wait to get more from her.  Thank you dear Mara!
"
"Thanks Mara, My wife loves her ring, your work is beautiful and AMAZING as always.
"
"What a gorgeous emerald! It has the most beautiful gradation of color and it's stunning with the rose gold bezel. Love, love, love this design! I just can't say enough about Mara's work and her wonderful customer service! Many, many thanks. üòäüíñ

"We both love our new wedding rings. They look exactly as appear on picture. The sizes are perfect. Couldnt have asked for more. Easy communication. No troubles at all. Thank you so much.
"
"I love this ring! Thanks for making it a custom width for us.
"
"Absolutely gorgeous!   I screwed up and ordered the wrong size. I didn‚Äôt notice until two days later.  I contacted the seller and he fixed MY error and didn‚Äôt delay anything at all. Super fast and friendly! Definitely will be purchasing more orders in the future.
"
"This is the second time I‚Äôm purchase a gift for my husband from this seller. He loves both pieces and always received compliments on both rings.
"
"This was a perfect gift! Beautifully designed, excellent quality! My girlfriend loved it! And KaLaiWong got it to me as quickly as I needed before Valentines Day.
"
"The seller went above and beyond and made this purchase very, very, special.
"
"It's a lot smaller in person. It says it is unisex but it's so dainty it looks as if it's made for children
"
"A very cute and unique piece!
"
"This is the most beautiful ring on Etsy!  I absolutely love the way it flows around my finger.  It feels like it was made exactly to fit my hand.  The stone is every bit as pretty as the one in the picture.  PERFECTION!
"
"Ordered after I got the first ring in my hands. This one is beautiful, just like my first one. Great work. Got it safe and on time (got it with reg mail, from Russia to Los Angeles). The ring is great, very interesting, and intricate metal work. I barely feel it when I wear it. The gemstone is natural. The stone color is beautiful green, when sun hits it.

"The ring is so pretty! I'd definitely buy from this shop again!
"
"Gorgeous, well made and just as described.

Olga was great about communication. FYI that I live in CA and it took six weeks to receive the item from Russia.
"
"So beautiful!! It's so sparkly! The picture doesn't do it justice. The engraving looks fantastic. Jackie was very willing to widen the band for me. Good communication & great craftsmanship. It came really fast too!
"
"This ring is so beautiful! It shipped earlier than I expected, and (so far) the quality is amazing! The clarity on the stones is great, and I get compliments everyday. Highly recommend this shop!
"
"The ring came very quickly and it looks amazing! Jackie was very attentive and communicative through the whole process, hands down one of the best purchases I've made. The ring is very good quality and it's hard not to keep looking at it. Highly recommend this Ring!
"
"The ring looked exactly the way I wanted it to! It‚Äôs beautiful and amazing quality! My fianc√© absolutely loves it and we are so pleased!
"
"Lovely set.
"
 
"Such a beautiful stacking ring and exactly as pictured. My husband bought it for me to go with my engagement diamond, as my wedding band can sometimes feel a bit flashy to wear with the diamond day-to-day. We got this for me to wear on the other days and it compliments it perfectly! Thank you so much! ‚ú®
"
"I absolutely love Dany‚Äôs work (shop owner/artist). I have purchased most of my gold jewelry from her. Her work is breathtaking!! I usually pair multiple rings together on one finger. This pic has 3 of her pieces in it. The top and bottom rings are specific to this retail posting. The middle, thicker ring, was also made by her. I highly recommend Venexia‚Äôs artwork/jewelry‚Äîyou will always receive QUALITY!
"
"We got this ring in Silver and it is so beautiful. I was extremely impressed. It is so dainty and sweet. It makes the PERFECT promise ring. Also the stones on the side cut off at the perfect spot so that it does not irritate the sides of your fingers. If you are thinking about getting this ring, do it! You will not be disappointed.
"
"I absolutely love this ring!! the heart is the perfect size, not too big and not too small. If you are debating getting this then you deff need to get it because it is beautiful. Shipped very quick!
"
"I absolutely love my ring! It‚Äôs perfect!! A little big but it‚Äôs okay!
"
"It's so beautiful.. just the right size.
I love it.
"
"I am so in love with this ring! It is exactly as on this page, I have several thin rings stacked on my wedding finger and wanted to include some gold since I wear more gold than silver. I love how it looks with my other jewelry and the quality matches my wedding bands as well. Soo happy!
"
"I ordered this as a thumb ring and pinky ring. Pinky ring size 1.5 and thumb size 5.5. Love them both! The stackable middle finger ring is a size 4 which I purchased from the sellers other listing. 10/10, very happy customer.
"
"I love this ring! It is the exact thickness I was looking for. Perfect for wedding band or to stack. The shipping was fast, it was shipped within 2 days of ordering.
"
"Love this ring! I ordered one yellow 14k 1.2mm ring before and I love the comfort and durability of it. I wanted one for my other hand so I recently ordered again. Ferko was so helpful in answering my questions before hand. Sizing is perfect and shipping was fast! I'll definetly purchase again in the future and recommend Ferkos Fine Jewelry 100%.
"
"The ring came in INCREDIBLE timing! I proposed to my boyfriend and he couldn‚Äôt be happier with the ring too! It fits him perfectly and the engraving is absolutely flawless! Thank you so much!! I highly suggest ordering from this shop, I definitely will be ordering from here again!! üñ§
"
"This ring is exactly what we were hoping for! My fianc√© went and tried on wedding rings at the local jeweler, and they were all pretty expensive. We wanted tungsten because it doesn‚Äôt scratch, but that means it was pricey. This ring is fantastic, and looks just as nice as those expensive rings at the store. The seller got the ring shipped out the next day and it came here early in the week. The ring met all of our expectations and more. I would recommend to anyone who is looking to buy here!
"
"My husband loves his new wedding ring. We saw on a different website some mountains engraved into a tungsten ring that he liked. It was expensive and we had a timing issue. We found this ring and got the laser engraving with his pick of mountains.  It turned out fantastic! On top of a beautiful product the seller was so accommodating to our timing needs. We live in a remote area that usually takes a long time to receive packages and she made sure to get his ring in the mail within a few hours of us asking. Unbelievably thrilled with the whole experience!
"
"The quality is amazing! Sunny was so helpful throughout the order. I wanted to change what I had originally wrote for the engraving and she made the changes no problem. My engraving was a little wordy but she fit the whole message and advised on what font to use be able to read the words more clearly. I will note that the ring is a little large on my husband (ordered a size 8 and it slides to his knuckle) but since he has thick knuckles he wouldn't be able to get a 7.5 over them! If he does decide to try a half size down, we will be ordering from Sunny again as the quality and care is unmatched. Thanks again Sunny!
"
"I love this ring so much! It has my baby's fingerprint - he died just after birth and I didn't have many prints. I sent the best one in (though it still wasn't great), and am so glad the ring shows the few distinct lines the print had.
"
"I‚Äôm honestly in love‚ù§Ô∏è my ring is absolutely stunning. The details are amazing! My order came in about 2 weeks after placing. The packaging was beautiful. The care instructions are simple. I spent hours deciding which shop to go through to keep a part of my father with me all the time. I definitely recommend her. Thank you so much ‚ù§Ô∏è
"
"Saying I love my ring does not cover how much happiness this brought me! So dainty and stacks beautifully. The attention to detail in my furbaby's paw print is breathtaking, beyond what I imagined! Thank you so much! I will definitely be shopping here for any personalized jewelry!!
"
"I am so happy with my ring. It is in memory of my son and helps me feel like a tiny part of him is with me. Thank you for making such a special product!
"
"Absolutely gorgeous!  Words cannot express how happy I am!  It compliments my engagement ring so well!  I‚Äôm so happy with the custom diamonds, the size is spot on...
Amazing work!
"
"I absolutely love this ring!!! Exactly as pictured when I purchased it. Really delicate and small like I wanted. A rare find, nothing compares to its uniqueness.
"
"I love this ring so much--it is lovely, and delicate, and just what I was looking for! The craftsmanship is beautiful. I'm so happy with my wedding ring and can't wait to wear it after my wedding this summer.
"
"Love this ring. I wear it next to my diamond anniversary band.
"
"Obsessed with these rings! I got this one and the brown one. They shipped so fast and I got them in 2 days ‚ù§Ô∏è
"
"these rings are adorable! i got the dark brown. i only wish there wasn‚Äôt a gap in between the ring but still fits perfect and is super comfortable!
"
"I‚Äôm in love with this little ring. It arrived so quickly and is a perfect fit. It‚Äôs my own little gift to myself!
"
"Absolutely beautiful! I wear one on each thumb and one on each middle finger! They are beautiful.
Thank you,
Susan
"
"I am absolutely in love with this ring!! It‚Äôs really dainty and so pretty. Very high quality, I will not hesitate to buy from Trium Jewelry again! Arrived quickly from Spain to the UK.
"
"I absolutely love this ring, it's so dainty and beautiful and it arrived extremely fast. I can only recommend it üòä
"
"absolutely in love with this ring, I bought both gold and silver and am impressed with them both!
"
"Absolutely gorgeous ring! I live in US and it arrived on time as promised. Good quality, cute, dainty and fits perfect. Will absolutely bring returning for more in many sizes.
"
"The ring looks lovely.
But I never received it. 
Tracking shows it has been sitting in another state here in the U.S for a month.
Etsy has refunded me.
*Update 060121
I did receive my ring. It is lovely. The mail is just taking a lot longer than seems right
I am very happy with my purchase and I let Etsy know I received it.  It is a lovely ring and the artist is very talented.
"
"Absolutely stunning!!!
"
"This jewelry is beautifully made. Takes a little while to reach U.S but worth the wait. I have several beautiful pieces.
"
"Buena calidad, muy bonito y comunicaci√≥n f√°cil con el vendedor. Un diez.
"
"The craftsmanship of this ring is phenomenal and I am so in love with my ring!! The only issue I have is something that is my OWN fault, not the shop owners whatsoever, I didn't size my finger correctly so it's too small for the finger I originally wanted to wear it on and too big for my smaller fingers, and the only reason I am including this in my review is to let others know to know your size for sure!! Otherwise you will be sad like I am but I can still wear it, I just have to be careful. I got mine with labadorite and I have to say this is one of the most beautiful pieces of labadorite I have ever seen, my photo doesn't do oringo's work justice! Will be purchasing again (next time I will know my FOR SURE ring size‚ò∫)
"
"This ring is marvelous- exactly as pictured, the serpentine stone gives it  very foresty feeling. The ring is well made, and the seller worked with me on some timing concerns, so overall 100% recommend this shop!
"
"This ring is amazing! Look as gorgeous as in the pictures. It's finely crafted to the smallest detail. Shipping was unexpectedly fast even though I live in Asia. Would definitely buy more pieces from Oringo!
"
"It‚Äôs perfect! Exactly as pictured, very good quality. I‚Äôve worn it almost every day since receiving it and not a scratch on it! Beautiful, thank you so much!  ‚ù§Ô∏è
"
"Came really quick! Items are as pictured. I‚Äôm a 5.5-6 in normal ring size and a 6 fit me perfectly.
"
"Purchased the black/pink glitter set for myself for the serge redeployment (ICU RN). They are high quality and cute too! Trust me I am ‚Äú ruff‚Äù on my hands:)
"
"I bought this ring with the engraving. SO COMFORTABLE. My husband agrees that it's super comfortable as well. I followed what the instructions said, if you're a 1/2 size, go up a size. I'm a 5.5 and my husband is a 10.5. I purchased a size 6 and a size 11 and they fit perfectly! :D
"
"My boyfriend and I love our rings! Ruff Rings did amazing and made sure we were satisfied with our purchase. I recommend ordering a size up as the silicone is tighter than rings made with other materials. My ring is a full size larger than my normal size and it fits perfectly :)
"
"beautiful ring!  perfect for valentine's day!  love how the raw black diamond sparkles!!  thank you mara!
"
"Amazing customer service, Jewelry is gorgeous real show stopper pieces.  Mara is amazing, don't hesitate and buy!
"
"Beautiful ring. Everything Mara designs is beautiful!
"
 
"Very fast shipping considering the ring came from Israel. I liked that the seller used Fedex vs the postal service.

The ring is gorgeous! It has incredible sparkle! It is difficult to believe this ring is just 1 carat as it looks like a 3 carat ring. I also like that the band of the ring gets slightly wider in the back. I‚Äôm very happy with my purchase! I‚Äôm wearing it as an anniversary ring.
"
"Love love love love love. The top photo shows the contrast in direct sunlight, and the bottom is inside. Depending on the lighting the grey will be more pronounced. (The colors seen in the bottom photo are from a stained glass window reflecting nearby!) I absolutely love this ring and am so glad we chose to order from Lena. She answered any and every question I had and the ring took only 3 days to arrive once shipped. After spending weeks looking for a salt and pepper diamond, I was thrilled to come across this listing. If you are even considering a salt and pepper diamond, do not hesitate to inquire about this beauty!
"
"So this is my second engagement ring, we got it to match my fianc√©‚Äôs wedding band since his is grey/black with black diamonds + rose gold trim. It‚Äôs so beautiful in person and people love it! 
I put a photo of the 2 ct. salt and pepper ring with rose gold alongside my original ring (not from etsy) which is a .65 center white diamond for comparison. My ring size is a 3.5. The seller was very nice and sent me a video and photo of the diamond she would use.
"
"This ring looks so amazing! I‚Äôve never seen a prettier ring, and my now fianc√©e absolutely loves it! The picture doesn‚Äôt do it justice. It looks so much better in person. I could not be happier about my purchase.
"
"This is beautiful ring! I was looking for something simple, slim, comfortable (and not too yellow) and this is perfect. David & Monica sent both the free sizer and my final order very quickly - both arrived within 2 days - and the ring came neatly packed in a nice box. Thanks so much! 

ps for anyone hoping to gauge their size without going into a store: the free sizer worked out well for me. I made my order using only this estimate. Now I have both in hand for comparison, they feel about 1/4 size off (my 5.25 ring feels more like the 5.5 setting on the sizer), but the ring is a great fit even though a teeny tiny bit bigger than anticipated. I think most companies don't even offer 1/4 size gradations : )
"
"I finally replaced my awful white gold wedding band with a yellow gold thin band, and I'm not looking back!  I'm so in love with my new ring!  It's 100% my style.  The fit is perfect (my ring size is 7.25 and Populent was spot on!).  I will definitely be purchasing from this store again.  Thank you!!!!
"
"I wanted a simple wedding band to compliment the dream engagement ring my fiance bought me. This was literally perfect.
"
"This ring is absolutely gorgeous! I am completely satisfied with my purchase. An issue I kept running into at other shops was inconsistent sizing. But this band was the exact same size as my engagement ring. Would 10/10 recommend. 
Pictured is the 2mm 14k gold wedding band, size 5.25
"
"I‚Äòve been wearing the ring constantly since it arrived and I am completely in love with it. The fit is perfect, the quality and detail astounding. I got a lot of compliments on it already. Also, the packaging was beautiful. Through no fault of Maya, the parcel got stuck in customs and took some time to arrive, she was very helpful trying to find out what was wrong. I can wholeheartedly recommend to buy from such a nice and trustworthy person. I will treasure the ring for years to come.
"
"I ordered this as my wedding band and it is so perfect! I shopped for months and couldn't find anything like it. I can't wait until I get to wear it every day! Thank you for making my dream wedding band!
"
"Honestly, I dont really like big flashy rings, so when I saw this I knew it was perfect. Its beautiful and elegant, and came it a handwritten note which made it all the more special. Thank you ‚ù§
"
"I love this ring. My husband used it as a wedding band. It is very clean and nice looking. The sizing is in fact true to size.
"
"It's beautiful and sturdy, elegant, everything my spouse and I could want from a wedding band! The rings look great together, and generally do stay in that stacked arrangement which is really visually appealing. The moonstone is always gorgeous, and looks different in all kinds of light at all times of day, and the diamonds have a great sparkle. Shipped right on time for our out-of-town wedding on short notice, so we really couldnt be happier!
"
"Was looking for a unique engagement ring to fit her beautiful personality and style and found it here! She was more than happy with this ring as it's unique and subtly screams ""look at me!"" without being too flashy.. I find her staring at it and smiling quite often. 

Highly recommend purchasing from this company; they were quick to follow up and confirm the order and answer any possible questions/requests. Ring was made to order and received in a timely manner. Overall a pretty painless process and worth every penny in my opinion; excellent quality product!
Can't Thank You Enough!!!
"
"Awesome ring. Super elegant yet simple. My fianc√© loves it and the combination of the band and the ring is just beautiful looking. Seller made it easy to buy and very friendly. 
Thanks Derick !
"
"This ring is absolutely gorgeous! Tried to find any that I would like just as much... couldn't find it! Derick was kind and understanding from the beginning. He produced and shipped the ring (to Quebec) in a timely manner. My fianc√©e loves it (she said yes!) :D
"
"Absolutely stunning ring. This is my second one I‚Äôve purchased and I‚Äôm in love! Insanely quick shipping and I cannot stress enough the quality of this beautiful little ring! Thank you so much!
"
"I got this ring for my boyfriend as a promise ring. He gave me one in February on the 13th we celebrated our valentines that day and my ring is made to seem like a rose because our our love of plants and I thought this ring is perfect for it and it was he loves it so much. I love it so much, it‚Äôs perfect. Thank you ((:
"
"Absolutely STUNNING! My fianc√©‚Äôs ring came in today and we are in love!!! My favorite color is green and he wanted something that made him think of me and the golden flakes match my ring perfectly! It is very light weight came in perfect size and width! Great price and got to US pretty quick!
"
"Absolutely gorgeous and so lightweight! They were also able to craft a custom ring for me to match my husband‚Äôs band. We just love them and can‚Äôt wait to exchange them at our five year vow renewal this fall! Thank you so much for all your hard work and excellent communication!
"
"I‚Äôm in love! I was so hesitant to order online but after reading the reviews, I took a chance. This is for our ten year wedding anniversary. This exact ring would‚Äôve cost me triple the price in store. The quality is great, the shipping was quick and I‚Äôve received so many compliments.
"
"I am so happy with my rings!!! I was nervous to order online but am so happy I did!! Great quality and so beautiful!! Thank you so much!!
"
"Absolutely amazing. I was nervous ordering a ring I couldn‚Äôt see first but I‚Äôm completely in love!
"
"In love with this ring! It's more beautiful than the pictures and was delivered earlier than expected. Seller got bsck to my questions very quickly.  Beyond satisfied
"
"I got this ring to wear until my wedding while my wedding band was combined with my engagement ring. I love it! It's beautiful!
"
"I LOVE IT! we‚Äôre on a budget so we couldn‚Äôt spend much on my ring but that didn‚Äôt mean we had to sacrifice beauty!! came on time, fits like it should, and people stay giving me compliments!
"
"I I'm LOVE both my rings so much!! Would give you 10 stars if I could! Fast shipping and even more beautiful in reality! So happy! 

Rekommenderar er alla att handla h√§rifr√•n! Ringarna √§r s√• fina, v√•gade inte ens hoppas p√• h√§lften s√• bra + snabb frakt! B√§ttre √§n b√§st, n√∂jdare √§n n√∂jd! 

THANK YOU!
"
"I LOVE THIS RING. I ordered a size 11 because I needed a 10.25. I took it to the mall and had it resized to 10.25 for $30 on the spot. Worth it. It fits beautifully, the shine is gorgeous, and everyone believes this is a real diamond ring. This is my promise ring. My boyfriend will be getting me a real diamond for our engagement. I can't wait :)

UPDATE: this ring has become my engagement ring for financial purposes. I‚Äôve had it for almost 3 months now and with regular cleaning, it shines so brightly that people believe it‚Äôs worth thousands. To clean at home: baking soda, salt, dish detergent, and hot water. Mix, let jewelry sit for about 10 min, then brush gently with a toothbrush. I promise this ring will not dull with proper cleaning. I absolutely love it.
"
"I had chosen another ring but I needed it shipped in a few days, before leaving for Italy. Zhedora proposed me this one she had in stock and I liked it more than the other! I asked her so many questions, they were answered promptly and kindly. I received the ring on time and, OMG, it was not as beautiful as in the picture... Much better! My fiancee is extremely happy. What else can I say? Zhedora is the best! Thank you!!
"
"I LOVE MY RING! Zhedora was always prompt responding to my messages. My ring took 2.5 weeks to arrive as I purchased the 18k ring, which as informed, takes a little extra time. Fits perfectly as well. I am extremely satisfied. I always smile looking at it :) Thank you Zhedora!
"
"Pictures do not do this sparkly, eye-catching ring justice. I'm in-love! I had my ring size measured at a local jewelry store and ordered with those measurements from Zhedora -- and it fit perfectly. I'm so happy! Thank you so much. ‚ù§Ô∏è
"
"I fell in love with this ring the moment I saw it. My boyfriend and I decided to purchase it for my 3 year anniversary gift. It took 9 days to get here which is amazing considering they had to resize it and ship it to Michigan. When I received it, it was half a size too small. An error on my part. But it was breathtaking. Pictures truly don't do it justice. I can't stop looking at it!! Thank you so much for my beautiful ring!
"
"AMAZING! I honestly can‚Äôt say enough good things about this ring. I ordered it expecting it to not be that great but it‚Äôs better than I could have expected. The band is very high quality and the stones are beautiful and very pigmented. Overall love love love!
"
"Absolutely gorgeous ring. Very dainty, but still stands out. Stones are beautiful. The ring doesn't feel cheap or like it's going to break. Turn around time and shipping were quick for a custom made item.
"
"I am in love with my ring! Beautifully made exactly to order. This ring is exactly what I was looking for and did not disappoint. I highly recommend buying from this shop. It was made and shipped sooner than expected with no issues! Thank you so much! In the future I would absolutely purchase from this shop again. Will be recommending to friends and family.
"
"Absolutely gorgeous and flawless! I am more than impressed! Exceeded wait time expectations considering that it was a custom order, my specific ring must have been started immediately! Will be my go to shop in the future! Thank you so much!!
"
"This is a very nice looking ring in rose gold.  For me, it is a tiny bit snug (fit) but it is still very comfortable.   

I Would recommend this ring and this vendor. üòä
"
"I absolutely love this ring, how dainty and bright it is! I love looking at it!
"
"Stunning. Delicate. Perfect. Classy. Understated. Meaningful. I am in love with this ring I wear with another ring from this same shop.
"
"It's beautiful and fits perfectly between my wedding band and my engagement ring
"
"I‚Äôm so in love with my ring ü•∞ Thanks
"
"Love before Valentine‚Äôs Day! This ring is perfect, I‚Äôll definitely purchase again 
Thanks

"
"Omg I just love my ring it's beautiful I would order again

"
"This ring is so beautiful! It shipped earlier than I expected, and (so far) the quality is amazing! The clarity on the stones is great, and I get compliments everyday. Highly recommend this shop!
"
"The ring came very quickly and it looks amazing! Jackie was very attentive and communicative through the whole process, hands down one of the best purchases I've made. The ring is very good quality and it's hard not to keep looking at it. Highly recommend this Ring!
"
"The ring looked exactly the way I wanted it to! It‚Äôs beautiful and amazing quality! My fianc√© absolutely loves it and we are so pleased!
"
"i love my rings. i bought 2 different sizes.  The stone is so pretty and they haven't turned my finger green. the shipping was less than 1 week. i would definitely buy from them again.
"
"Loved it! My ring was even prettier in person. Picture didn't do it justice!
"
"love the size of the ring. I had ordered this one because I couldn't find my other opal ring. I love this ring!
"
"This ring is absolutely gorgeous. I got the wrong size, but I‚Äôm so in love with it and definitely recommend to others.
"
"I love it!! My engagement ring is from James Allen and I wanted an inexpensive wedding band to match it. I was nervous about quality, but this band is PERFECT!!!! I am so so so happy with it! Looks just as expensive as my other ring. Great customer service, highly recommend!
"
"This is the perfect dainty ring! Sizes are spot on and I‚Äôm so in love!!!
"
"Love the ring...just what I wanted!
"
"This ring looks great for the price. It matches my engagement ring well even though it‚Äôs only gold plated. It will be a good temporary solution until I can buy a better quality band. No one knows it‚Äôs not real gold/diamonds.
"
"Purchased this ring to propose to my now fiance and she absolutely loves it. The pictures just don't do it justice. It is beautiful! Will was very responsive and the order shipped a month early! 10/10 would order again.
"
"Beautiful ring, pictures don‚Äôt do it justice. My partner was thrilled with it and so was I. Seller was also very communicative and shipped it extremely fast. Highly recommended!
"
"Thank you so much! The ring is exactly as advertised and we couldn't be happier. I added the rush order and the ring was complete within 7 or 8 business days just as specified.
"
"Most beautiful thing I have ever seen. Thank you so much!
"
"It‚Äôs beautiful and well made! I‚Äôm in love üòç
"
"I ABSOLUTELY ADORE this beautiful little ring. It's perfectly unique, delicate, and so feminine.  I get so many compliments on it and it makes me feel so special. Its the perfect little treasure and my favorite piece of jewelry i own. I could literally stare at my hand all day. THANK U SO MUCH FOR THIS PERFECT LITTLE RING. ü•∞
"
"The ring is beautiful and was delivered well before the anticipated shipping date.  The owner was responsive to all of my messages.  The ring is well made and was exactly what I was expecting!
"
"I am speechless! I love pearls ü¶™ and this wedding band is perfectly paired with my pear shaped engagement ring! It take a little long due to making it but it‚Äôs definitely worth it!! So in love! Thank you for this suede box to keep my rings in üíò
"
"I absolutely love this ring. It is perfect. I probably should have gone with a slightly smaller size because in the winter time it will def just fall off. But I'll just order another one in the right size and have two of these. This ring is just gorgeous. Shipping was fast too.
"
"Love my ring!!! It‚Äôs so delicate and so pretty . I will def buy more rings from this shop !
"
"Again this ring with the other are very beautiful and the seller was very easy to work with! I‚Äôve had this ring for about a month now. No tarnish but since it is so dainty it does bend little. But it doesn‚Äôt bother me! Still a very beautiful ring! Excellent seller will definitely be buying more jewelry in the future!
"
"Beautiful!!! Looks just like the pictures. Good quality, arrived fast, and came in a nice ring box.  I loved my ring so much I ordered another ring from this seller the same day my ring arrived:)
"
"I love my engagement ring it is just beautiful and we get sooooo many comments about how stunning and unique it is! Thanks so much!
"
"Beautiful ring and a beyond lovely design! Fianc√© adores it and I'm very happy with the purchase. Don't anticipate ever needing to purchase an engagement ring again, but if I did I would purchase through your company.
"
"Beautiful ring! The picture does not do it justice. My fiance and myself could not be happier with craftsmanship and communication through out the fabricating process to delivery. Cheers!
"
"Absolutely love the ring, never taking it off :) on top of the ring being gorgeous MinimalVS's customer service was outstanding and they helped me with all my questions. Thank you so very much,
Love Collin and Tina
"
"Beautiful ring! Looks exactly like the photo. I bought this as my wedding band. It looks perfect next to my simple diamond engagement ring.
"
"More delicate than the photo suggests this beautifully detailed design lends a vintage feel to my engagement ring.  It is the anniversary band I've always dreamed I'd wear.
"
"This ring is even prettier than it looks in photographs, my wife absolutely loves it. I waited until kind of the last minute to buy it before my wedding and am so thankful the seller had a rush order option, it was delivered to me so fast! I would leave six stars if I could.
"
"Looks exactly like I had hoped.  Pairs perfectly with my engagement ring.
"
"Gorgeous! Looks exactly like the picture and the one posted by other user. I chose cubic zirconia due to my budget limitations and feel extremely satisfied. You'd never know it wasn't real diamond! I was looking for an engagement ring that was rose gold, affordable, and simple (which wasn't very easy for me to find!). Extremely satisfied with this, love wearing it everyday. Shipping was also very fast, received within the few days that I ordered (I chose express shipping for a few dollars more). Thank you very much AlyaPersonalized!
"
"The ring is perfectly awesome! I love it so damn much that i could just about give Alya a big bear hug if i ever get to meet her. The craftmanship is impeccable and it is as expected based on the photos...only better coz I have it now. The support and service provided by Alya is like warm choco in a cold winter night. She was there to guide and help throughout the decision process all through the wait for the package to arrive. Now back to the ring, I have tiny delicate hands (size 3) so this ring was perfect for me. It gave just the right amount of bling to suit my minimalist tastes. I love the fact that it sits flatly on my finger so it does not get caught into things. As i said, awesome!
"
"I was very nervous about ordering this ring! I live in the United States and so ordering something this important and this expensive was very terrifying for me since I've never ordered from overseas. 

I had so many questions and Alya was so accommodating and answered all of them. We messaged back and forth for over a week before I finally felt comfortable enough to order it. 

The ring is amazing! It looks incredible and is a perfect blend of being simple but yet very elegant and unique! My fianc√© is in love with it and I'm so happy I choose to go this route! It is affordable and is great quality! I had also contacted people that had left reviews before and they said the same things about the ring.

I would highly recommend using Alya and especially the express shipping because it got here so fast! 

I'm incredible pleased!
"
"The ring came in so much faster than expected. It is absolutely beautiful and my fianc√© is in love with it!
"
"The ring is absolutely stunning. It's so beautiful and dainty. Jabby even replaced two of the diamonds with two different shades of tourmaline to really make it my own.
"
"This was our engagement ring, it was absolutely flawless. She loved it so much and of course said yes!!!
"
"Ring was shipped exactly (maybe a little earlier) as expected. Made it here in great condition. The ring itself was small and dainty. Everything about it is great. Would highly recommend buying from Jabby/LoveRingsDesign.

I had quiet a few questions/wants that Jabby and I talked through after ordering. Jabby helped every step of the way and even took a video for me to show how the different rings looked!
"
"I ordered this ring in white gold with a slight alteration to close the gap between the center diamonds. The final product is gorgeous, and I absolutely love it. Jabby was extremely easy to work with, and she made sure I loved the final design. I would 100% recommend this ring and this shop!

"Irina was wonderful to work with. She provided progress updates and responded quickly to messages. It's a little nerve wracking to have a wedding set made rather than just picking one out at the local jeweler. But the end result was amazing. The set is perfect and looks beautiful. My fiance loves it! The word everyone uses to describe the engagement ring is stunning!! The wedding band matches perfectly! Thanks Irina!!!
"
"Irina is amazing. She took what I wanted (a ring with a higher setting to accommodate for an heirloom wedding band I wanted to wear later) and made it come true. I was a bit indecisive over which center stone to get and she took a video of my top 3 choices to help make the decision and gave me advice as well. My fiance had proposed with a ring pop so that I could get exactly what I wanted and I am so glad he did. When he told me I can get anything I wanted I knew I wanted a creation from Irina. I had been following her Etsy shop and her Instagram and loving everything I was seeing. The Montana Sapphire I ended up getting was around 2.6 carats I believe and gorgeous. It's blue in some lighting, almost green in others and is truly what I would call a Mermaid Montana Sapphire. I love the color of the stone and workmanship.
"
"These turned out so great, and we have gotten so many compliments on them. ‚ù§Ô∏è
"
"Irina helped my fiancee and I design our dream custom ring. We had a general idea of what we wanted and Irina helped us find and select the perfect diamonds and then walked us through several iterations of redesigns. She was so patient and helpful. Communication was AMAZING--very responsive and timely. Shipping was super fast and secure. We were initially nervous about designing and purchasing a ring all online without being able to touch it and see it and try it on but we were absolutely blown away with the quality! It is even more gorgeous in person than what we imagined and what the design renderings looked like. We are already planning on having Irina make the wedding band too and we have absolute faith in her! She's the best and we couldn't more highly recommend her!!!
"
"I love my new rings ‚ô•Ô∏è ordered in pink and charcoal for the days I choose not to wear my diamond wedding band  üíç I ordered the wrong size at first and Steve is amazing in making sure you get your rings in the correct size! The rings are very comfortable too! The best customer service!! They show how much their business means to them by making sure you‚Äôre happy ‚ô•Ô∏è
"
"just received my ring today. after gaining some weight in my current pregnancy I decided to get a temporary ring that could stretch a little! it serves its purpose well thus far. fits just right and comes off easily.
"
"Love my ring. Been wanting one for the longest. It literally didn‚Äôt even take a week to get here. ü§ç
"
"I love my ring so much! Fits perfect, doesn't pinch, and shipping was super fast! will buy again for sure!
"
"It took a while because of customs, but it was well worth the wait because this ring is beautiful! Feels so soft on my finger and looks stunning. I couldn't be more happy with it!
"
"The ring came out so cute and came in a few days early! I‚Äôm super excited to see how it wears, but it fits perfectly and I‚Äôve already gotten so many compliments on it! Thank you for such wonderful customer service and a quality product, I will be returning
"
"Valeriy's work is awesome.  I love this ring.  He worked with me to get it to us in time for our wedding and was super quick, getting it to us a week early.  The rings were just what we wanted.
"
"I just received this ring today and I can‚Äôt stop looking at it! It‚Äôs beautiful! It fits perfectly and is so silky on the inside and comfortable I know I will wear it a lot. Excellent workmanship! Thank you!
"
"I was extremely (and pleasantly) surprised by how high quality this ring is. The CZ stone looks amazing and glimmers just how I was hoping it would, I love everything about it. Thank you SO much!!
"
"I absolutely loved my ring. It was exactly what I was hoping for. I would recommend this shop to anyone looking for inexpensive but beautiful engagement rings. It‚Äôs perfect!!
"
"I am so in love with my ring I was a little scared at first but I wouldn‚Äôt ask for anything else the sizing is great and the overall is gorgeous I 100% recommend it!!!
"
"I LOVE my ring. It's exactly what I wanted. Very happy
"
"Love my ring! Absolutely unique and gorgeously stunning! Beautifully rare crafted Art Deco ring...which you cannot find these days... Lauri was wonderful to do business with! Great communication! Thank you so much for the wonderful diamond ring to someday pass down to my daughter!
"
"Stunning!
"
"I love my ring.  It is just as pictured, shipped quickly and I was able to track it so I knew exactly when it arrived.
"
"The item was exactly what was described, I received the Item quickly, and the owner of the business was excellent to deal with. I would definitely purchase from her again.
"
"Absolutely beautiful rings. Engraving is elegant and clean, symbol came out wonderfully, and there isn't any sign of scuffing or anything on the rings. The quality of the ring box it comes in is questionable, but considering the price point and the quality of the rings, I can't complain about the box at all.

I did run into one issue with shipping. My first order was lost in the mail somewhere between China and the US. I messaged the seller when the delivery date kept getting further and further away and within a day they had a new one on the way. And that one arrived a day earlier than predicted!

Overall I am very happy with my order and look forward to possibly working with this seller again in the future.
"
"We are in love with the rings, they came fast & are absolutely beautiful. Thank you!!
"
"Amazing quality. Rings are extremely shiney catches the light very well, illuminating what's around it. Very well made. Ingraving is very clear and precise. Shipping was quick. Bonus gift was not expected but was a delightful surprise. Also very well made. The cords are very strong and the latch is unique, having a smooth finish so it is good to wear and won't scratch you. 

The box they come in is sturdy and holds them snug, and is well packaged. 

Seller  is a dream to work with and will be ordering again from them.
"
"This is so beautiful ! I order this and when I realize I put the wrong size they were so helpful by changing it to the new size. I love the boxing of it too so cute! Thanks a lot !!!
"
"I wish I could give this a million stars. Howl‚Äôs Moving Castle is my #1 comfort film. This ring was a birthday gift to myself to help keep a bit of light with me at all times when I‚Äôm feeling low. Stephenie is the kindest soul and helped me extensively with my sizing issues which were my fault alone. The ring itself is so beautiful and well-made. I will treasure this forever.
"
"The ring is so pretty ! She was very attentive and answered all my questions ü•∞ü•∞ü•∞ it‚Äôs exactly like the picture. I got a July faceted ring in the size 6 3/4 and it‚Äôs abit big but I don‚Äôt mind !
"
"just got it today and i‚Äôm so amazed at the quality omg so worth the wait! I got the aquamarine stone and it‚Äôs absolutely beautiful in the sun ü•∫ seller is also the greatest at answering all my questions and concerns! here‚Äôs a little pic with the ring and the best boi modeling for the best howl ring ü•∞ would definitely buy from her again <3
"
"this ring is beautiful. i can‚Äôt even describe the excitement i had once i opened the little ring box. it‚Äôs incredibly made well and i might have to save up to buy another ring from this brand. it‚Äôs absolutely gorgeous.
"
"The diamonds are bright, vibrant & beautiful & the gold is shiny & nice. I love the ring, however I‚Äôm giving 4 stars instead of 5 because it says in the description that the band is 2mm thick & it‚Äôs actually a tiny bit thinner, so it doesn‚Äôt fit exactly flush with my engagement ring which is definitely 2mm thick. It does still look very beautiful though & the seller sent it lightening fast! Will shop again!
"
"I wanted something to add to my wedding stack and this new ring is perfect! I got the 1.7 in white gold and it‚Äôs SO sparkly and goes perfect with my other rings. I already want to purchase another. Thank you!!!
"
"White gold 2mm, perfect! I LOVE this ring!! I wasn‚Äôt sure about purchasing expensive jewelry on Etsy but it is delivered fast and the ring is so sparkly and pretty. I‚Äôm glad I ordered 2mm üòç
"
"Customer service was above and beyond. Murray is so kind and accommodating! My ring got here in one day. 
In terms of the ring- I mean wow. My new ring (pinky) very clearly outshines my other diamond band. Guess I‚Äôll need to get a new one from here haha. Photos don‚Äôt do a justice although they‚Äôre still beautiful. This was taken in a dim setting, don‚Äôt even get me started on the sparkle when a little light hits them.
"
"I can't get over how gorgeous this ring is.  Photos do not do it justice. It's simple, classic, and elegant.
"
"This ring is absolutely everything I was hoping for! It‚Äôs GORGEOUS!!
"
"The ring is so beautiful I'm in love
"
"Absolutely stunning piece of jewelry!  This ring exceeded my expectations and I will definitely be looking to order more from this shop.
"
"Yelena was so patient with me and offered a fantastic payment plan so I could afford a beautiful ring for my amazing girlfriend on my own time. The ring is stunning and my now-fiancee is so happy with it, and says it's absolutely perfect. Yelena even allowed me to add expedited shipping so the ring arrived just in time. The ringbox even came with a little light to accentuate the sparkle, which was a wonderful touch.
"
"Yelena was so patient and communicated with me with every question and request when creating a custom ring for me. I am just stunned with how incredible my ring turned out. It‚Äôs absolutely beautiful. It fits perfectly and turned out better than I imagined! She used the raw diamond I was proposed to with and created the most beautiful wedding ring with it. She included me in the design process and kept me updated throughout. I am so happy with my ring. It‚Äôs perfect.
"
"I can't find enough kind words to express my feelings about how cared for I felt throughout the entire process! The end result is incredible. Several people have already expressed their ""ring envy"" and I don't blame them. Yelena deserves all the credit and I will be singing her praises to the end of time!
"
"Absolutely in love with this custom band that Yelena designed. She used the lace trim on my veil to design the beautiful wedding band that fits perfectly with my engagement ring.
"
"As others have noted, it took a while to get here (> 3 weeks), but it looks great! The packaging is thoughtful, as it comes in an adorable little box. I asked Sergei to engrave my wedding date inside the ring, which he did (clearly by hand, which gives it some personality). This ring is exactly what I was looking for. Therefore, completely worth the wait. Thank you!
"
"Absolutely unique ring. So beautiful and simple. And it came in such gorgeous packaging! Can‚Äôt thank you enough. A lifetime of happiness is represented in this ring!
"
"This is so perfect. My fianc√© loves it and the engraving makes it special since he wanted a very simple and small ring. We postponed the wedding but decided to wear our wedding bands anyway because we got excited when we saw them
"
"I purchased this for my husband after getting married in november. I ordered in the beginning of january and it arrived mid february. The shipping took the longest, but it was coming from across the globe so I am not bothered. It is beautiful and matches his style very well, he loves it too. I picked this out for him myself
"
"Best buy ever. I had a hard time justifying buying my husband a ring he's already lost once before. This ring is PERFECT for him, though. It's heavy duty, fits perfectly, and he loves the matte in the middle. I ordered one and it ended up being too big, so Mike helped me reorder effortlessly along with providing a ring sizing item for free! Phinomanal seller, great product. Highly reccomend! Thanks Mike!
"
"I was having a hard time looking for the perfect wedding band in rose gold for my fianc√© that was affordable. Mike was very helpful and answered all my questions. This is the perfect ring and it's beautiful and so is the engraving. Shipping was super fast!! Will do business again. Great shop!! Thank you!!
"
"I ordered this ring for my fianc√© but it was too big! The seller was wonderful in sending us a ring sizer immediately through the mail before we exchanged the ring for a more accurate size! We cannot wait to receive the new size! Thank you!!
"
"We knew we wanted a tungsten ring for their durability and price. Finding the right size (a 15!) for my fiance was a challenge, however. We just got them today, but he loves it. It's very comfortable, obviously great quality, and looks great on him! We couldn't be more thrilled with the ring, the engraving, and Alex's overall customer service! And it shipped soooo quickly! So happy. We'll definitely shop with AlphaTungsten again.
"
"This ring is amazing, purchased for a friend's 40th birthday (for her husband). Working with the company on timing and shipment was fantastic.  Communication was amazing.  Highly recommend!!
"
"I will be honest I was very nervous ordering a ring that I never seen in person. It was a risk as my total purchase was over $6k. I said a little prayer and submitted my order lol. I could not believe the ring that I received. It is absolutely more than I could ever image. I been loyal to my jeweler in NJ for over 20years and now have a change of heart. Thank you so so so much!
"
"Let me start by saying my fianc√© and I could not find an engagement ring that we absolutely loved. All of the rings looked the same. Until I saw this ring. I was skeptical because I couldn‚Äôt see it in person. I just loved it so much I took the chance. There is a 30 day return policy if I did not like it. This ring is absolutely GORGEOUS!!! I can‚Äôt stop looking at it. It surpassed all of my expectations. I love that it was made for me  specifically. Rose gold which I love and engaged as well. The ring is worth 2x what we paid for it. The workmanship is impeccable. Don‚Äôt hesitate to order this ring if you love it!!
"
"BEAUTIFUL BEAUTIFUL RING! The clarity of the ring is WOW! Definitely looks way better up close. Dalia was very patient and answered all my questions. I live in California so when it came to the shipment it was way sooner then we thought! I will definitely do more business with her in the future. You will not be disappointed in your purchase.
"
"This ring was more then I could have ever asked for. My future husband bought this for me as my engagement ring. I still havent stopped staring at it. It is absolutely breath taking. It's so well hand crafe, detailed and unique. It fits perfect and it georgous, I haven't stopped getting compliments on it.  Thank you for making my perfect engagment ring.
"
"I cannot express how happy I am with this ring! I wish I was a better photographer cause it's even more beautiful in real life. Thank you! Thank you! Thank you! Prettiest thing I own.
"
"This ring is beyond amazing! Husband got it for me as a new wedding ring and I couldn't be happier. I was a little nervous because I thought it was going to be bulky but it's not at all! It's super comfortable, like nothing is there!
"
"Gorgeous, gorgeous ring w/ wonderful communication.  I asked for a custom stone (a labradorite) and was sent pictures so I could choose the exact stone I wanted.  With such a thick ring, I was worried it would feel bulky to wear, but it is very light and comfortable.  The design is phenomenal.  I'll definitely be back!  Thanks so much!!!
"
"Ring arrived faster than expected and is so beautiful! I‚Äôm definitely more non-traditional and this ring caught my eye immediately as something I could see myself wearing instead of a traditional diamond engagement ring. I‚Äôm so happy with my purchase.
"
"my fianc√© LOVES the ring. she wanted a simple/thin band & it is absolutely perfect. when i proposed, i saw her eyes light up. & i still find her gazing at it throughout the days. i asked for it to arrive by a certain day & it came even a day earlier! was glad to help a small time business during these times & i am beyond thrilled that they delivered on this ring. i absolutely recommend them to everyone. üòå
"
"I am absolutely blown away by how beautiful this ring is!! This ring is everything I wanted it to be and more! Im in love!! You guys done a great job! Thank you so much!! üñ§
"
"The ring was gorgeous, and the fit was perfect! I couldn't have found a better engagement ring. Absolutely stunning, everybody has complimented my fiance on her ring. 

The shipping was way faster than projected, which was also nice. While the oxidizing rubbed off quicker than I had hoped it would, the ring is still perfect.
"
"It shipped on time and the jeweler was able to expedite the process to accommodate my proposal deadline. The jeweler was very open in communication and very helpful answering questions. I would absolutely do business with this shop again.

As for the ring. My now fiancee describes it as delicate looking, while also feeling sturdy and solid without being clunky. I loved the profile view of the ring, and it may even look better in person than in the pictures. We are both a big fan of the ring and think it a beautiful. In the end, it got her to say ""Yes"", and that's what really matters.
"
"Wow. My son wanted to get engaged after he graduated from Navy Boot Camp. I mean right then. He called me during Boot Camp and said he needed a ring with a Morganite in Rosegold and vintage. I had three weeks to find and purchase and size!  I found this ring with a Moisanite, requested it be changed to a morganite.  I looked at the website and it said five weeks were needed to make the ring.  I wrote the shop owner told him the story and he had it made for me within a two week timeframe and sent to me. It arrived on time it was perfect it was beautiful and mostly it was exactly what she wanted. They both loved it. She gets compliments on it daily.A big thank you to the jeweler. Thank you thank you!
"
"This ring is absolutely gorgeous. I wish I could give this more than five stars! I can't keep my eyes off it, it's so perfect. One of my newly engaged friends actually said this ring is so beautiful that it made her like her ring less. 100% would recommend GNG Jewel to all of my friends!
"
"This ring looks even better in person! Photos don't do it justice. Gene was great to work with and I absolutely love my new ring!
"
"Absolutely perfect replacement for my wedding ring that I lost. Looks just like my previous platinum ring and I am absolutely delighted with it. No one can tell the difference and for the price then it is just incredible. Thank you so very much.
"
"It‚Äôs perfect! It fits nice and I won‚Äôt hit it on anything at work! It‚Äôs smooth and pretty pretty! I‚Äôve worn it for a week and it hasn‚Äôt turned green at all. I‚Äôm loving it.
"
"Arrived quickly. Very comfortable. With the band alone, I hardly realize I'm wearing it. I've never worn a wide wedding band, but needed a slightly larger ring for a while. This our 3rd purchase. In 2015 we ordered a matching ring for my husband and a 3 stone anniversary band as my 15th anniversary gift. Both are still in great condition and very comfortable. We shop here first if we are buying a ring for anyone.
"
"I ordered both rings here. One is titanium and surgical steel with the same thickness, 4mm doesn't look like the same with what i received. The surgical steel is thicker as you can see at the photo. Anyways it was made nicely. I like it both. Thank you
"
"beautiful ring!  perfect for valentine's day!  love how the raw black diamond sparkles!!  thank you mara!
"
"Amazing customer service, Jewelry is gorgeous real show stopper pieces.  Mara is amazing, don't hesitate and buy!
"
"Beautiful ring. Everything Mara designs is beautiful!
"
 
"Brought 3 rings. This one, the forget me not, and the moss. All beautiful and true to size! Love wearing rings on my thumbs and middle fingers so they fit perfect! Would definitely order again!
"
"Super cute! Didn't realize How small my guages were LOL. BUT I still like them! I thought I knew my guage but this are a tad bit big and can not get them in BUT thats ok!! I am going to keep on trying to get them in LOL
"
"I have been eye balling this store for a solid while now. Especially with covid, I was nervous about shipping times seeing as it's based out of the country. It was about 3 weeks, but so so so worth the wait. Customer service is top notch! I had no complaints, and didn't reach out, but was kept alerted to every single update. Shipping estimate, tracking number, everything I received an email. These plugs are incredibly beautiful, perfect inch and a half. So unique and dainty and feminine! ADORABLE! 10000/10 recommend. Will 100% be a return customer!
"
"i bought these for prom and i love them!! they‚Äôre high quality and absolutely gorgeous. i‚Äôm a size 00g so i was afraid that the crystals would be too closely packed to look good, but i took the chance on buying them and i‚Äôm so glad i did! shipping was fast and the packaging was really nice. they even included how to care for the plugs and a warning that water might damage them ! i don‚Äôt have a good picture of the plugs, but even a good picture could never show how gorgeous these plugs are in person!
"
"I love how unique this ring is! I had a diamond ring before but lost the diamond. This is what I chose to get to replace it. I‚Äôve always been drawn to things that are different and this ring was exactly what I didn‚Äôt know I needed! The detail work is beautiful and continues around the band. The moonstone is even more gorgeous and I can‚Äôt help myself from turning it to catch the light . I am very happy with y purchase, worth every penny!
"
"This ring is gorgeous!!! All I can say is that if you want this ring get it. Also, it‚Äôs a ring set and I just stack them on top of each other or wear separately. It‚Äôs exactly as described. The construction is remarkable. The moonstone has a glow to it and is very captivating. I charged it this pass full moon and it‚Äôs just wonderful! I‚Äôm very happy I went with this ring.
"
"I absolutely love this ring set! My husband got me this new wedding ring set because when I saw it I fell in love with it, and the uniqueness of it! I love the outdoors thanks to my grandparents who used to take me hiking, and this ring just screamed me! The size chart is perfect! The quality is perfect! And shipping was so fast I have had to wait I think like 4 days before I could leave a review! I highly recommend!! Thank you so much for this beautiful, unique, perfect for me ring set (:
"
"Thank you so much for the speedy delivery. The craftsmanship of this ring is absolutely breathtaking and the colors of the stone are marvelous. I love everything about it and is just my style. Tha k you again for how quickly it shipped to Cali. We thought it would take at least a month and it came within a week of ordering. So in love. Thank you!
"
"Love this ring! My fianc√© is not a jewelry guy AT ALL. Every time we talked about getting him a ring he would talk about how he just doesn‚Äôt like jewelry and isn‚Äôt a ‚Äúring‚Äù guy. So when we found these I was surprised he liked them enough to settle on it. Well I‚Äôm glad he did because he loves and I love it and it goes perfect with our lifestyle, theme and matches my rose gold ring.
"
"Couldn‚Äôt have asked for a more handsome anniversary ring for my husband! I originally forgot to fill out that I wanted it engraved/burned, contacted the seller, and he got back to me immediately and still made it happen! I am so thankful for it, and my husband couldn‚Äôt be happier! Thank you!
"
"Highly recommended this shop and their products. I had to exchange my ring for a different size. This couldn‚Äôt have been easier. The ring is beautiful and looks just like the pictures.
"
"I finally gave my wife her ring on our one year wedding anniversary ! It‚Äôs so beautiful it fits perfect ü§© she absolutely loves it the delivery process was so fast. Thanks soo much
"
"I‚Äôm so happy with this ring! üíì It‚Äôs a peachy treasure with a dreamy swirl pattern in the bezel, a special design of this store. This pretty thing lifts my spirits and the little inscription inside the band reminds me to do my best and do right by others üòä The ring showcases the peach-orange sapphire so perfectly, and I think it even changes color in different lighting! I mostly like to wear it on its own, but sometimes wear it with some friend rings around it! The store owner is a true artist and her rings, necklaces, and earrings are a joy to behold! Everyone should shop here, you‚Äôll receive a lasting treasure! üê£
"
"The earrings are beautiful but very very tiny.  I got them for my 7 month old and still feel like they are tiny for her.  Otherwise the stone (sapphire) is beautiful shiny light pink color and the gold part is sturdy. The seller is very nice.  So I guess I didnt really expect it to look so small, I thought they would be same size as my diamond stud earrings (which I measured to be around 3mm). I‚Äôll try to attach photos to show you what Im talking about. Anyway, I guess it‚Äôll do for a little while but Im probably going to look for something bigger in the future.
"
"I absolutely adore this ring.  It‚Äôs unique yet timeless.  And I really love how it‚Äôs a relatively flat profile, no snagging!

Super fast shipping, too.
"
"If I could give this review 10 stars i definitely would! Five stars doesn't account for the quality and craftsmanship. Nicole designed and crafted my custom wedding ring. Her design was a perfect balance between a antique/modern style ring. I really wanted an one of a kind ring; something that could be passed along to my children. A ring I could wear daily without worrying about loosing a stone or snagging my clothes. I feel like Nicole understood what i wanted and delivered well beyond that.
"
"Wow!  That's what I say...wow!  I am literally blown away at this quality ring and clearly fine craftsmanship.  I so prefer this look to a jewelry store emerald ring--even if they were identical in price, which clearly, they are not, my obvious choice would be this one.  Grab one, and feel wonderful wearing it!

"
"These are super cool rings; very rough, edgy, and beautiful!
"
"The seller was so good to create two custom bracelets for me. One was for a gift, and the other for me (my second from this shop). I can't even say how much i love them. They're dainty and gorgeous and I never take them off. The recipient of the gift loved hers also!! Really really lovely items and the seller went above and beyond. I can't wait to order again.
"
"my gf looks so pretty in these üòç
"
"Super produit de qualit√©
Je recommande 
Le Vendeur est disponible et tr√®s agr√©able 
La finesse du produit est vraiment remarquable
"
"Working with this shop was a great experience! They are prompt, had good communication, the ring is beautiful and exactly as described, and the box it came in was very high quality. 

I will definitely purchase from them again ü•∞
"
"Absolutely gorgeous. Shipping to the US was incredibly fast!
"
"Beautiful ring and excellent service- thanks!
"
"I love this ring, it sits so nicely and looks gorgeous on my hand, so simple and so good ü•∞
"
"Love this ring! Fits well, looks good (I like that it‚Äôs middling thickness, not as wide as some rings like this I‚Äôve seen but also not too tiny/thin). And it rolls beautifully, it‚Äôs the perfect fidgeting ring!
"
"This is exactly what I had in mind - a thinner silver, non bulky ring.  This is adorable and perfect. :)
"
"I love it! A beautiful ring and just what I‚Äôve been looking for to mark the birth of my second child. Excellent quality. Fits perfectly. I‚Äôm so pleased!! Thank you!
"
"Love love love love love. The top photo shows the contrast in direct sunlight, and the bottom is inside. Depending on the lighting the grey will be more pronounced. (The colors seen in the bottom photo are from a stained glass window reflecting nearby!) I absolutely love this ring and am so glad we chose to order from Lena. She answered any and every question I had and the ring took only 3 days to arrive once shipped. After spending weeks looking for a salt and pepper diamond, I was thrilled to come across this listing. If you are even considering a salt and pepper diamond, do not hesitate to inquire about this beauty!
"
"So this is my second engagement ring, we got it to match my fianc√©‚Äôs wedding band since his is grey/black with black diamonds + rose gold trim. It‚Äôs so beautiful in person and people love it! 
I put a photo of the 2 ct. salt and pepper ring with rose gold alongside my original ring (not from etsy) which is a .65 center white diamond for comparison. My ring size is a 3.5. The seller was very nice and sent me a video and photo of the diamond she would use.
"
"I can‚Äôt stop staring at my new engagement ring! Honestly it‚Äôs one of the prettiest rings I‚Äôve ever seen. My fianc√© is very proud of it and I‚Äôm a very happy fianc√©e. He says his favorite part is how much I love it. Lena was amazing and patient answering all our questions about fitting it with wedding bands we had from my grandma. She even gave us a little sneak video to help with our excitement (though to be honest it was all my excitement)!  Shipping was incredibly fast! I hear nothing but compliments when people notice my ring!

"Words can‚Äôt even describe how impressed I was! At first I was skeptical ordering a ring without seeing it in person. However I‚Äôm so glad I did! Lena was amazing throughout the whole process! My boyfriend and I picked out this ring together as my engagement ring, but has not yet proposed, so waiting to officially wear it! Highly recommend this shop! They were very flexible with payments and doing custom sizing. Couldn‚Äôt have had a better experience!
"
"I love this ring. It's hard to find a raven ring that sits close to the hand. The sculpting is lovely and expressive.  My only concern is that the band with the tourmaline is so tiny, I'm afraid I might lose it. The seller was great at communicating, which I think is so important when buying expensive jewelry on line.
"
"Love love love my beautiful raven - and so do all that I have given a sneak preview to as not officially mine for another week! He is majestic, mysterious, and has a very strange "" pulling power "" that no other ring that I have ever owned, has. That is the magic of Genia and all the talent and love that she has put into this ring, one very special girl! Forever a devotee!
"
"WOW!  What an amazing ring!  I adore ravens and just loved the unique nature of a ""nesting"" raven with a sparkly orb.  Also ordered another companion ring and specified shiny silver, which I think is fun with the beautifully oxidized raven and the companion ring that came with it.  Actually put all 3 rings on together and loved that look too!  A+++
"
"I always wanted a raven ring and i could not belive when I found this artist the perfection of this ring!  I wear it always and my raven companion never leaves me! Looking forward to purchase more from this artist!
"
"Harold does absolutely /stunning/ work, and he is incredibly helpful if (like me) you accidentally ordered the wrong size. I now have two rings from him (loved the first so much I got another!), and I absolutely adore them. They're well made, and very affordable for the high quality that they are!!
"
"I received my ring in the mail with a very nice personalized note. The ring is of very good quality. I didn't want anything too big and this is the perfect size. It is made very well, looks good on my hand. I am very happy with my purchase and look forward to buying more pieces.
"
"I absolutely love this ring! I haven't taken it off since it came in a couple days ago. The handwritten note was very nice. Will definitely be buying other rings in the future!
"
"I liked the style of this ring. After exchanging for a smaller size it fits perfect! LOVE  IT. I bought it for my pinky finger and wear it every day.
"
"Bague fine et tr√®s √©l√©gante. Je viens d en racheter une pour offrir!!
"
"Love it!!
"
"This ring is so cool! Thank you.
"
"Disappiinted. Ring is beautiful. But its made from the soft, brittle metal children's adjustable rings were made from in 80's gumball machines.. it's going to break any second. I'm very torn because I really like the look of this ring but the quality warrants a few dollars.
"
"The little whale is gorgeous, and fitted very nicely. I've been wearing it daily since. I have bought from Moon Raven Designs before and have always been very pleased with their excellent quality.
"
"I saw this ring months back, and I absolutely adored it! I finally decided to order it as a late Christmas gift to myself. It was delivered very promptly after I ordered, and came very safely packaged. Now I wear it every day! It's so cute and classy at the same time. I'm in love!
"
"This is a fun and beautifully crafted ring. I've received many compliments and comments on its whimsical style. I love that it's slightly adjustable (with caution) and that it's sculpted on BOTH SIDES (inside the ring)! A nice hidden surprise for the wearer.
"
"I love this ring so much! It arrive a few days before expected. Thanks!
"
"Oh, my goodness...  This ring is A-MA-ZING!!!  I love it! There is only one thing: I wish I had purchased it sooner...  Laura could not have been better in communicating with me. Thank you, my new friend, for making this ring for me. ‚ù§Ô∏è
"
"Une tr√®s jolie pi√®ce, la taille est parfaite. Je suis vraiment heureuse d'avoir pass√© commande √† Laura. Je recommande son travail sans h√©sitation. Elle est disponible et √† l'√©coute. 
Ma nouvelle bague favorite! ‚ù§Ô∏è
"
"La bague est parfaite ! Elle ne me quitte plus depuis que je l'ai re√ßue. Et quelle rapidit√© d'envoie ! Je suis plus que ravie !!
"
"J‚Äôai re√ßu la bague rapidement, dans un joli emballage. Elle me va parfaitement et est d‚Äôune qualit√© incroyable ! 
Je suis totalement fan ! 
Encore un grand merci √† la cr√©atrice qui prend soin de chacune de ces cr√©ations et de chaque client avec ses petits mots.
"
"I love this ring. It is so perfect and exactly what I expected
"
"Everything was super dainty! Pefect rings!
"
"Absolute incredible!!! Shipping was fast and the ring is gorgeous!
"
"Absolutely love it ! I receive so many compliments on it. The only reason I didn't give 5 stars is because the metal is too malleable it bends like crazy for anyone that uses their hands often. Easy to shape back though !
"
"I absolutely love my rings that I ordered. While the package came a month later than expected, I always got quick replies from the owner. I already knew I would love this purchase but when I got it in the mail it was hand packed in cute gift wrap and then again packed with more cute tape and you can tell effort and time went into arranging the package. The rings fit perfectly and in amazing condition! It was so so worth the wait! Thank you :)
"
"I absolutely love it! It fit perfectly and is so stunning! Super worth the price and the wait! It took a little less than a month to get here!! :))
"
"I absolutely love this ring set. I bought it as promise rings for my girlfriend and I and I cried when I opened it. we don‚Äôt get a lot of representation but this ring is truly perfect.
"
"Such a beautiful ring! I absolutely love it! Shipping took a lot longer due to Covid-19, but the seller was great and handled all of my questions, they even reshipped it for me. Will be buying from them again!
"
"Thank you Mary! And Koten Studios! I ordered this back drop necklace in silver and it is absolutely stunning! I will be wearing it New Year's Eve with a V backed black dress for a Phantom of the Opera theme.  Perfect! And on top of that, I requested matching earrings which were made just for me and they came today. Wow! Very fast on the shipping! If you are thinking of purchasing anything from this amazing artist,  do it.  You will not be disappointed!  If I could fill in more stars, I would!
Pam
"
"Wore these 1 day, and had so many compliments on them. Love these!
"
"Incredibly sexy and gorgeous. It is delicate and I keep worrying I‚Äôm going to break it but I love it.
"
"Very Happy<3 <3 <3 <3
"
"Absolutely in love! Thank you for the beautiful ring!!!!!
"
"I love everything about this ring! It's 100% perfect!
"
"I love this ring. It's perfect. C. Savage
"
"Love my ring, exactly like the picture! Thank you
"
"Shipped on time, seamless ordering, and I love this ring. It's so much fun to fiddle with but is really subtle and lovely, and can easily be worn in any setting and at any level of dressiness. I am honestly considering getting more, to wear on other fingers, I am such a fan. Probably my favorite of all my fidget rings. Thank you!!

The only thing I would note for other buyers reading this: size up a little more than you think you need. As I'm finding with may fidget rings, the multiple rings can make the opening smaller than the listed size, which I tried to account for but should have gone up even more, I think. This one (7.25) fits best I would say on my size 6.5 finger across all temperatures.
"
"I love this ring. It feels so substantial on my finger - not heavy but you can feel the quality. This is exactly what I‚Äôve been looking for!!!
"
"this is a duplicate purchase, due to weight loss (!!!), but i just couldn't be without this ring. it is one of my favorite pieces.
"
"I bought this a month ago and I'm in love with the design. The rings spin well, but I find myself rolling them over each other up and down my finger more often. Wonderful for my attention and anxiety issues, and not as obvious as a previous spinner ring I had. I play with it constantly, probably more than I realize, and only take it off to shower but it seems to be holding up well. Large sizing also a plus. So, so happy with it and will come back if I'm ever interested in something else!
"
 
"The ring arrived on time and in beautiful condition! I‚Äôm in love! I bought this ring as a temporary replacement for my wedding band/engagement ring and I‚Äôm so pleased! So pleased! 

I ordered a size slightly larger than the finger I had it slotted for. Just in case it 1) ran small or 2) ran big, so it would fit another finger, and it exceeded my expectations! (I wear a typical 1/2 size on most of my fingers so it‚Äôs a personal struggle of mine.) 

This ring is more gorgeous in person than in the pictures and worth it!
"
"Looks amazing and arrived super fast
"
"I love this ring,it's beautiful and fits perfect!
"
"I absolutely love these rings! They‚Äôre exactly what I wanted. They‚Äôre so dainty, very thin, I barely feel them on my hand which I love. They‚Äôre also a beautiful yellow gold, perfectly shiny. I love this shop and the delivery was very fast!
"
"I couldn't be happier with the four rings I ordered as a gift for my daughter's 20th bday. She's always buying cheap rings that distort in shape and/or whose finish wears off.  I wanted her to have quality rings while avoiding the over-priced offerings of a typical jewelry store. These are tasteful, original and ""irresistibly minimal"" without being flimsy or cheap looking AT ALL! All four rings are beautifully made at an incredibly fair price for this level of quality. I chose the ""small wave"" ring plus a set of three bands, all in gold, all equally beautiful. They're stunning whether worn stacked on one finger or separately. The small wave ring in particular is a show-stopper. I'll be saving this shop‚Äîit's the first place I'll visit the next time I'm shopping for jewelry. 
PS: copy-pasting one review for both orders.
"
"I absolutely love the rings I purchased. They are dainty and simple and look perfect with my engagement ring. I will be ordering from Jon again in the future. I received my rings within 3 days, very impressed!
"
"These rings are so beautiful! (The v ring is also from this seller). Amazing quality and very dainty. Shipping and packaging was quick and super pretty. I haven‚Äôt worn them much yet since I just opened them but they seem to be very sturdy. I will definitely be ordering from Joe again, I highly recommend these rings. Great price and beautiful.
"
"Beautiful ring! fits perfectly! Great communication with the seller, I really appreciate it.
"
"Absolutely Perfect! MiurArt went beyond beautiful! I ordered a smaller heart diamond than was offered and well the result was just what I wanted! Petite and just the right size. Dana you are the BEST! THANK YOU AGAIN! ‚ù§
"
"Beautiful craftsmanship! Love it! Dana was great and promptly answered my emails. Was happy to accommodate my custom request. She kept me up dated on shipping as well. Really talented artisan! Thank you!
"
"The Bat Mitzvah girl LOVES this beautiful pendant and necklace. The box in which it came was...WOW...and she hasn't taken the necklace off her neck since the day that it was delivered. This is a gorgeous piece of art and we are so happy!
"
"I purchased an exquisite Art Deco platinum engagement ring mounting from Antique Jewelry Co. I was helping my son who , for the longest time, was looking for a very special engagement ring for his future wife. Finally,  he decided to use a quality stone from our old earring and fit it into an antique, delicate mounting  The owner of Antique Jewelry Co , Mark, was a pleasure to work with. Prompt, courteous  and professional. We ended up getting from Mark THREE mountings and picked one my son liked the most.Actually it was Mark who suggested that we should examine each mounting and see what it  looked like with our stone.  What a great idea! The mounting we ended up choosing was the least likely contender based only on photos.  We received refund for returned items immediately. Mark, thank you so much  and we will be back!
"
"I had many questions when buying this setting for my diamond. Mark was AMAZING and answered all my questions immediately! He was by far the best seller I've ever bought from on Etsy! He even had his jeweler change the prongs to accommodate my diamond shape for free!  The prong setting was slightly large for my diamond but my jeweler was able to adjust it and make it fit. It shipped literally overnight and the packaging was incredible! If you're on the fence about buying jewelry from Mark you won't be disappointed! Do it!
"
"Dearest Mark,
The ring arrived and it‚Äôs absolutely gorgeous! Way better than I expected. It also goes really well with my wedding band. The fit of the ring is perfect so thank your sizing jeweller for that. I‚Äôm just sitting here on cloud 9! I completely love this ring! Thank you so much for your excellent service and for delivering the ring to me the very next morning. Packaged with extra care, and with a gift from Florida. A nice touch. And came with the appraisal card and in a very nice ring box. You‚Äôre just the best!
Sincerely,
Erica
P.S. I showed it to my antique jeweler and she said it‚Äôs an exquisite ring and 100% authentic. The setting is original and in perfect shape and it‚Äôs a really awesome diamond. She said it was worth more than I paid.
"
"Mark was such a pleasure to work with, he made the whole process of buying something as delicate and special as a wedding band‚Äî online no less, a breeze. My Art Deco French cut eternity band is so beautiful, pictures do not do it justice. And it goes with my engagement ring perfectly. I always knew I wanted a French cut wedding band, and I searched for quite some time before I found the perfect one. Mark even had his jeweler size it for me before shipping it out. The quality and service of this transaction were a dream, and the beautiful diamond band is just more than I could ever wish for. Thank you, Mark!
"
"some of the cutest staples and timeless pieces! she‚Äôs so quick to help with any inquiries you may have. and minimal packaging that still makes the pieces feel special üíï
"
"The ring is everything I hoped it would be: great finish, minimalist. I've been wearing it consistently for a few weeks now and it's holding up great!
"
"Precioso como los dem√°s de la tienda
"
"LLego en apenas dos dias, se ve muy bien y la presentaci√≥n en su cajita es chula. No se puede pedir mas a algo con ese precio
"
"This ring is so beautiful, unique and well-made. It‚Äôs heavy and sturdy, goes with everything, doesn‚Äôt get caught on anything and is the perfect size. I was a little concerned if it‚Äôd be big on my hand, but it fits comfortably and snug. Definitely worth the price for the high quality of this ring.
"
"Lovely,unique ring
"
"I love this ring. Quality and well priced rings. It is made well, doesn't change in colors or irritate my skin. Another great purchase and arrived pretty fast.
"
"I wear both the rings I got through this shop all the time. My new favorites. :)
"
"This ring is beautiful and fits perfectly, thank you so much!
"
"D√©lai parfait. Produit et finition de qualit√©. Je pensais juste que la bague serait un plus lourde. C'est de l'argent recycl√©.
"
"Arrived much quicker than I expected! Absolutely gorgeous, simple, modern design and a bit larger than I expected which I love. Makes quite a statement!
"
"what this women does it truly amazing. I'm so unloved with my ring. I even cried when I seen it. it was even more beautiful in real life than on the pics. totally perfect. and the customer service is faultless. would definitely recommend and have already told so many people about her and the magic that she create üñ§üñ§üñ§
"
"I just love this ring and everyone is telling me how much they love it!!!
"

"
"I love all the pieces.
"
"Really great ring, fast shipping. Only thing I didn't like was that the chain doesn't stay in place. Other than that, I highly recommend!
"

"I love my seahorse ring! It goes nicely with the seahorse pendant. The fit is perfect. It arrived packaged in a lovely box. Thank you Sarah!
"
"I love this ring, it's so delicate and beautiful! I can't stop looking at the seahorses. Packaging was great, including the crocodile saying 'thank you' sketched on the envelope :) Thank you, Sarah!
"
"This is the cutest seahorse ring! It‚Äôs very realistic and made of sturdy metal. I would definitely shop at this store again!

"
"Mein ""Kalma-Schmuckst√ºck"" macht mich jeden Tag gl√ºcklich :-) Die Ohrringe sind sehr besonders gearbeitet und geben mir das gute Gef√ºhl eines wertigen Schmuckst√ºcks. Besonders gef√§llt mir, dass es sich um ein Unikat handelt, das von Katrin mit viel Hingabe, Kreativit√§t und Liebe zum Detail gefertigt wurde. Ich werde st√§ndig auf die Ohrringe angesprochen und bin stolz, ""meine"" Goldschmiedin (Geheimtipp!!!) als Designerin und Produzentin angeben zu k√∂nnen. Mit dem Versand klappte alles ganz unkompliziert, die Kommunikation mit Katrin l√§uft super. Ich kann Kalma jedem empfehlen, der Wert auf individuellen, sehr besonderen Schmuck legt.
"
"Ein au√üergew√∂hnlich sch√∂ner Ring mit hohem Tragekomfort - f√ºr mich ein besonderes Schmuckst√ºck mit Aussagekraft. Ich trage ihn sehr gern! Wie immer war die Kommunikation mit Katrin √§u√üerst angenehm, der Versand blitzschnell. Vielen Dank!
"
"Happy birthday to me.   Love this sweet thing.   It's very sturdy & beautifully detailed. ‚ù§Ô∏è
"
"I love the ring. It is very flexible, which makes it easy to fit exactly, but also easy to catch on something and bend. Package also did not ship within the normal expected time. It took almost a month from ordering to receiving, but I am still very happy with this ring!
"
"I love this ring! And it is the only one I'm wearing because normally I do not like rings. But it is so decent and perfect fits my finger. Now I have to save my money... to eventually buy the necklace... or another one from Victoria :D definitely my favorite shop.! <3
"
"It's beautiful
"
"This is one of my favorite rings, I simply love it! It took a while to get to the United States, however I knew it would and didn't mind the wait. I highly recommend!
"
"Delivery was so fast, just 12days! The ring is beautiful, just like in the picture! I wear the ring every day! So comfortable, great, great work! Size is perfect, too. Thank you so very much.
"
"Absolutely cool ring!  Designer so easy to work with and very helpful! Great craftsmanship!  So reasonably priced too!
"
"Gorgeous ring.  Elegant, yet simple and classy.  Will definitely purchase from this seller again. Thank yo so much!
Love it!
"
"Amazing set of claws and came so fast with express shipping. Thank you!! My wife absolutely LOVES them (she got them as an early present)
"
"Fantastico, come da foto e spedizione puntuale, forse solo un po' larghino sul polso ma niente di irrisolvibile ^__^
"
"very nice item. 
Me like!! :-)
"
"Amazing!!! Thank you so much
"
"I was a little hesitant to get this ring because of the price and not knowing how it would look on my hand but as soon as I saw it I fell IN LOVE with it! I get so many compliments. It's amazing quality and the fit is just snug enough to not move at all on my finger but not too tight that it feels uncomfortable. I HIGHLY recommend investing in one of these and I love my sloth so much I will be buying a 3 - piece owl next. Well worth the money.
"
"Thank you very much for this lovely ring(set), I fell in love with it already online but it looks even better for real! The sloth is beautifully made and has a very cute face, the detailing is unbelievable and it fits my finger perfectly, everything great. Thanks for the ultrafast shipping, too!
"
"I received this beautiful creation within some days after order - delivery took only a few days from Thailand to Europe.
The ring is very beautiful and of high quality! A really amazing eye catcher.
Thank you so much MaryLou.
"
"The ring came today!  I absolutely love it!  The gift box it came in is beautiful too!  My daughters birthday is Sunday!  I can‚Äôt wait to give it to her.  Mary Lou does fantastic work.  Thank you so much, Lori

"
"Absolutely stunning ring true to description and great delivery. I love it and it has had many admirers and compliments.

"
"Love it.
"
"I love the ring, the stone is a little big for my small hands but it‚Äôs beautiful non the less. Shipping was on time and I was notified every step of the way. I received a little surprise in my order. A lovely pair of earrings. I will definitely be telling the lady‚Äôs about.
"
"Loooove everything about it. I got this to replace my wedding ring until i get another one. The packaging was so cute i didn't want to open it. I really appreciate the little gift it comes with. My 3 year old like it so much she asked if she could have them. Lol i'll definitely buy from the shop again.
"
"I love my ring!  Thanks Hely for your sweet gift!  I will be back to purchase more soon!  You are a fantastic designer!  Shipping was terrific!     
All the best, Jill
"
"Absolutely Sensational!
Love, love love it!
"
"WAYYYYY nicer then the pictures gave it credit for!!! One of the most GORGEOUS rings I‚Äôve ever seen!!! My fianc√© and I thank the company so much it‚Äôs so amazing üòµüíïüëçüèº
"
"I was looking for a ring exactly like this for my daughter and me. I did want the design modified a little bit. The jeweler was very prompt, accommodating and responsive.  I sent photos of what I wanted and the changes were done perfectly! I bought the ring in 2 sizes and 2 gold colors (yellow and white gold).  Everything about the process was 5 star. The quality is impeccable. The service was exemplary. The design is simple, beautiful and exactly what I wanted! I was initially nervous when I learned the jeweler was not in the US, but my concern was wasted energy as the product and shipping was exactly on time with no issues. In fact, I was pleasantly surprised, as the rings arrived in individual ring boxes which had a small light illuminate on the ring upon opening. Without question, I would purchase from this jeweler, again.
"
"The ring is absolutely beautiful, really sparkly! the design is too cute, amazing and beautiful. Guy was really nice and helpful all the time. The shipping was extremely quick. It‚Äôs a unique and amazing ring!
"
"Than you.  I am very happy with the ring.  Guy even rushed ordered my delivery, so I could have ring on time.  I definitely recommend his services.  Thank you again.
"
"The item was just as described, it felt smaller than the size I requested, I just moved it to a different finger and it worked just fine. It looks great with the rest of my ring collection!
"
"Lovely ring, just as pictured. I‚Äôm happy a wide range of ring sizes were offered since my ring finger as quite small. Fast shipping as well! I‚Äôll definitely be a return customer.
"
"Such a unique gorgeous bracelet! I love it even more in person. ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
"
"Beautiful. Just as i pictured..quality is perfect..
"
"I love my rings! They are exactly what I hoped for - fun, delicate and funky.  Sherine at DeMedeis Jewelry was an absolutely pleasure to work with. I needed some size adjustments and an early fix on one of the rings, and she quickly took care of it for me. So happy with my purchase, thank you DeMedeis!
"
"Beautiful design and craftsmanship.  The ring I purchased needed some adjustment, and there was no problem at all to get what I needed. Wonderful shop!
"
"Could not be happier!!  The ring is stunning, the communication between us couldn‚Äôt have been better & I received the package earlier than expected.   I will without question be buying from her again.  Anyone looking can buy with absolute confidence. The workmanship & materials also seem top notch. Seamless & perfect on every level. Thank you Dahlia!
"
"Spectacular ring, even more beautiful in person!  The quality and craftsmanship are as high as any good jeweler I‚Äôve been too in person.  Glad I took the chance!  Communication with the seller was excellent and her offer to size the ring post delivery was very appreciated.  Will be buying again!!
"
"love this ring! it is very pretty.  shipped really fast
"
"Absolutely beautiful
"
"Exquisite and delicate ring. The opal is beautiful with lots of fire in the stone.
"
"Fabulous service gorgeous ring very happy
"
"Love this ring.  I get so many compliments, I may have to buy another to start stacking my rings! Thanks! Beautiful Piece :)
"
"I now have two rings for stacking love the effect.
"
"Just received this ring I ordered for my girlfriend and she absolutely loves it! Thank you and we'll definitely be back for the next gift... Jonny & Charlie, London
"
"Lovely, lots of compliments. It was a bit more rose gold than expected. I will order again and remain a huge fan! Best, j
"
"I was looking for something specific when I ordered this ring.   I wanted a cage ring that was a step up from the other ones I had found on Etsy.  I love this ring. It is sturdily designed and is unique.  The shipping was from out of my country, so I was a little hesitant, but it arrived rather quickly and in perfect condition.
"
"I adore my ring! Unique and beautifully made!
"
"This ring looks great and gets lots of compliments! I found the sizing was a little smaller than other rings of the same size from this store. It could be because of the double band.
"
"I love this ring too much! So beautiful, feminine!
"
"I just got my ring yesterday- it arrived so quick! I ordered just 3 days ago! I love it!! My fingers are kinda chubby so I have a hard time buying rings online, afraid they won‚Äôt fit. This adjustable is perfect! Got it just in time for scorpio season and my birthday!
"
"Super cute and just as pictured! Good quality. Packaging was beautiful too. The only thing I would make note of before buying is ring size. I did not ask ahead of time what size it comes in before adjusting. I have large hands and wear a size 9 ring and assumed I could adjust it to my finger. I can, but the space between the stinger and the ""M"" is wider than I like. But if you have average size fingers, this ring is perfect. I'd say size 6-8 will fit best.
"
"order arrived very quickly, and the ring is beautiful! if you have skinny fingers, be careful, because the ring is a little big (just over a US Size 6) and JUST fits my skinny index finger. otherwise, I love this ring!
"
"I LOVE IT!! An amazing gift for yourself and for your friends!! Great quality rings that are adjustable (first ring from the left is adjusted bc I have really thin fingers). Thank you Adelina for your wonderful service!!
"
"I love my ring!! I love the rustic look to it. The names came out super clear my only hiccup is the one ring that is underneath the other is almost overlapping the first letter in the name. I wish it was pushed out just a little bit.
"
"Ring is beautiful and exactly what I was hoping for, thanks so much!!
"
"Bought this for my sister and it turned out fantastic. Not to mention she absolutely loved it. Thank you MCDecarie for sharing your talent with us. I'll definitely be shopping in your store again!
"
"I've ordered three different rings from this company.....and am about to order another.  All three are different with personalized messages ... I could not have been happier with all three.
"
"Molto bello,l'ho preso in entrambi i colori,ottima fattura,fa davvero un figurone:)))
"
"Have bought several things from this seller. Really happy with each item! I wear the rings all the time, simple and modern to go with everything.
"
"Beautifully made.   Takes a little while to get to the US, but that's to be expected.  It was worth the wait. Thank you!
"
"Love it! Amazingly fast delivery to the UK! No hassle purchase
"
"Fell in love with this jewelry on a trip to Israel. So so glad there‚Äôs an Etsy shop!! Unique and well made!
"
"I am in love with my beautiful square gold ring! It has such a cool slightly chunky feel but still looks delicate and slim. Shira has been nothing but brilliant, not just in her wonderful ability, but in her attention and care when the postal service went a bit COVID. So happy! Thank you! X
"
"I just got my ring !!! I'm obsessed. It's so stunning. Fits perfectly. I love love love it xo
"
"Gorgeous ring!   Uniquely different and yet somehow still a super classic, simple pearl ring!

"So cute! Love my ring!
"
"Wundersch√∂ner Ring, passt sehr gut!!
"
"The ring is amazing and fits perfectly! AND THE BOX WHOA! To be 100% honest, I have carried the box around for the past week because the box is so satisfying with its magnetic lid. It‚Äôs been perfect for stress relief!!! Would recommend BOTH of these!!!
"
"Beautiful! Just what I wanted as a wedding ring. A little thinner than I was thinking but for the price you can't beat it! It's also much lighter and prob will forget I'm even wearing it. Engraving off center but thats ok. Overall AWESOME!!
"
"My boyfriend and I absolutely loved the ring! We got it so he could have one that matches mine (I'm on the left and he's on the right). It arrived a day earlier than expected wrapped in a cute little box with a bow and the ring box inside it. The free engraving was such a sweet offer. The engraving itself was small and thin very subtle but lovely all the same. I would 100% order from them again and I will definitely recommend to friends! :)
"
"It's 100% perfect! It's arrived super fast & in perfect condition. I'm so excited to give it to my boyfriend when he comes home from deployment! It's going to make it even better.
"
"I‚Äôm so happy w the way my earrings + ear climber turned out. They added the perfect amount of edge to my wedding look.
"
"The ring took a while to get here, but that‚Äôs to be expected when it‚Äôs coming from so far away! The ring is amazing, the stone is flawless, the fit is perfect and it came in the most beautiful wooden box! My boyfriend is thrilled!
"
"Such gorgeous earrings.perfect for my dress on our daughters wedding day. Love love..thank you
"
"Absolutely gorgeous! I was afraid to buy online but it is a true masterpiece. Thank you so much! Definitely will order something from your store in the future.
"
"It shipped fast. The necklace is well made, beautiful, just thought it was bigger, but realized its shown on a smaller scale body form and not actual person.
Thank you!
"
"Another unique item!  I even asked to have the item altered and the artist agreed to the changes and sent pictures of the piece for me to approve before she sent it.  She is an example of the best of what Etsy is all about.... a direct connection between the artist and buyer for the benefit of both!!!
"
"Beautiful necklace . Light as a feather.  I LOVE it.  Very fast shipping - thank you.  I received endless compliments on it.
"
"Die Kette ist wundersch√∂n!!!! Die Farben sind sehr sch√∂n!
"
"I absolutely love this ring! I recently got engaged, and none of the diamond rings that I looked at appealed to me. But, I wanted something special to mark the occasion and to wear on my ring finger. This is serving as my engagement ring, and I couldn't be happier. Thanks so much!
"
"Live up to expections, perfect fit and minimalist style. Love it! Thank you :)
"
"Beautiful design. Thanks so much!
"
 
 
 
 
 
"Sooooo beautiful. So lucky I have it‚ù§Ô∏è
"
"Really helpful when I was seeking more information about the moonstones he had.  This one that I settled on is so special, both with the mini-gumdrop shape of the moonstone (with amazing blue adularescence) and the lovely details on the gold band.  An excellent experience and a ring I love!  Thank you.
"
"First of all, Peter is a very nice person/seller. He did everything that I asked him before purchasing quickly. 
I got this ring on Feb.22 (including resizing). This ring is amazing! I'm very happy with this ring. BUT, my ring is smaller than I expected. It's not his fault, because this was the first time I purchased from the UK. So I should have researched my UK ring size more carefully.  I can wear this ring only on my third finger or my left middle finger. I wanted to wear this on the index finger. but now I really like to see the ring on my right third finger. 
Thank you, Peter!
"
"So happy with this ring, prettier than in photo!
"
"Bague fine et tr√®s √©l√©gante. Je viens d en racheter une pour offrir!!
"
"Love it!!
"
"This ring is so cool! Thank you.
"
"Disappiinted. Ring is beautiful. But its made from the soft, brittle metal children's adjustable rings were made from in 80's gumball machines.. it's going to break any second. I'm very torn because I really like the look of this ring but the quality warrants a few dollars.
"
"My beautiful ring arrived sooner than expected! Great quality!! Absolutely love it!!!
"
"Love
"
"This is a very nice, quality ring. I highly recommend this shop and this ring!
"
"Love the ring--it's so pretty!
"
"A gorgeous ring that compliments its matching earrings beautifully! So happy I purchased them together!
"
"I‚Äôve got earrings and a ring as a set and it looks fabulous! Such a beautiful work! Flowers look as real.
"
"I was worried and reached out to Anna and she responded quickly giving me the shipping and tracking info. They arrived today and I am so overjoyed!! These are perfect and wrapped so beautifully!!!! I got these 3 days earlier than expected!! THANK YOU ANNA!!!!!! <3 <3 <3
"
"The earrings look even better in person than in the picture, absolutely stunning, and the owner of the shop was so nice and so extremely helpful in getting them to me in time so I can wear them to a friends wedding out of the country! Absolutely the best service and an amazing product! My picture doesn't do them justice, they look amazing!
"
"I Love the hinged ring that I purchased from you....it fits perfectly and looks fantastic on me!
Thank You so very much 
Stephanie
"
"I love my ring :)
"
"Such a gorgeous ring. Excellent craftsmanship.
"
"It fits my ring finger well, but it‚Äôs a little too small for my middle finger that I wanted to wear it on. However it‚Äôs beautifully made and sparkly.
"
"Perfect! Just as described, quick shipping, cute packaging and awesome seller!(:
"
"It's bit different then I expected. I love it still
"
"Had some shopping troubles (I'm not sure how the mysterious postal system works) but we got there in the end! 

The earrings themselves are super cute, big, and fluffy - what more could a girl want!?
"
"Love them so much! They were a great finish to my festival outfit.  Louise was also so lovely and helped me make sure I got them in time. Love love love üòäüíñ
"
"Nikki Tatter is a shining example of what makes Etsy so rewarding and worthwhile. I purchased this beautiful ring. It arrived well packaged, well made and with a beautiful note attached. When it didn't arrive as expected, Nikki responded to my concerns quickly, professionally and was engaged to resolve the matter immediately. I will be keeping an eye on her Etsy shop for other beautiful things as I wouldn't hesitate to purchase from her again. 100% recommended.
"
"Wonderful rings! I will love to wear them!
"
"Love it! Fits great! Thank you!
"
"I love it. thank you very much
"
"Very pretty and well made.  I am very happy with the ring.  Well done.
"
"Beautiful Ring - great service/quality
"
"I wear it everyday. Thanks.
"
"I received my beautiful ring when the seller (Nikoletta) said I would. It is a stunning ring, a gorgeous hot pink colour & as lovely (if not more lovely) as it looks in the picture. It fits me perfectly & the packaging was beautiful too. All communications with Nikoletta were very easy. I highly recommend this shop & seller. Thanks Nikoletta.
"
"This pendant is incredibly beautiful.....meticulous metalsmithing, fabulous asymmetric design, gorgeous peridot, and the perfect size and scale! The packaging was also lovely, making for a wonderful presentation. I very highly recommend this shop!!
"
"El env√≠o lleg√≥ a tiempo y perfecto. Los pendientes espectaculares y la presentaci√≥n super cuidada, la joya ven√≠a acompa√±ada de una toallita para limpiarla y algo que me sorprendi√≥ y me encant√≥ es el olor que desprend√≠a la cajita al abrirla. Sin duda repetir√©.
"
"El dise√±o es muy bonito por su originalidad y por si acabado, pero para m√≠ tienen un inconveniente....pesan bastante!!!!!
"
"I am delighted to own and wear a true work of art, created by an artisan who attends to every last detail from the creation and workmanship of the earrings and pendant to the presentation in the delivered items. All perfect! Item was shipped immediately. Immediate responses to my inquiries.
The photos on a live model helped me in my selections. They were perfect!
"
"Beautiful Irish claddagh ring and so unique from all of the rings that I have seen. Thank you so much!
"
"Love this small ring, haven't taken it off since it arrived. I will definitely shop from this store again. The quality is as advertised and looks exactly like the photo. It arrived within the time expected.
"
"Truly lovely set of little lockets.  I bought them to add to my antique chains and bracelets.  One locket is like new, and brings out the style of a necklace made of an antique watch chain. One is for an antique silver guard chain. The size and patina are perfect. The smallest is to clip on a Victorian charm bracelet.  It will be the only charm, and again it suits the bracelet in both style and size. I appreciate that I could buy this collection together because each locket had a place on my existing jewelry. The price was excellent. Dealing with the shop owner was so pleasant. She returns messages quickly, and she has a level of integrity that I rarely see these days. Shipping was fast as well.  I love ""window"" shopping in this store and have quite a few items on my favorite list. I definitely will be back!
"
"Love love love...Thank you so much !
"
"I am absolutely in love with my handmade ring by Joanna Szkiela. This ring is beautifully crafted as well as surprisingly delicate and comfortable. I am slowly buying every piece of the Rune Ring collection from Joanna's RedSofa shop. :)
"
"Second purchase from Joanna & I just placed an order for a third rune ring. Her designs are beautiful & look exquisite on the fingers! I could not be more happy!
"
"I have not taken this ring off. I wear it all day, everyday, it doesn't even come off for bed. This is my second ring from Redsofa and will definitely not be my last. Very beautifully detailed and well made. :)
"
"I love this ring so much!  This is my second ring from this store, and the quality has remained wonderfully consistent.  The fit is perfect, they were willing to accommodate quarter sizes.  There was a little mishap with shipping, the tracking number didn't go through and we didn't understand why, but the shop owner contacted me immediately when she realized the problem, putting my worries at ease.  Would recommend this ring and shop to anyone!
"
"I adore this little ring ! Just as described and fast delivery. I previously had purchased a much more expensive but similar ring of vermeil from another seller and it tarnished almost immediately but this lovely brass ring looks even better and shinier after wearing. LOVE it !
"
"I love this ring! It's exactly what I was looking for-- and I spent months looking for this specific design. Delivery was quick and the owner was very accommodating. I highly recommend!
"
"really pretty minimal ring, arrived super fast in amazing packaging. as with all brass rings, be careful with green fingers but this can easily be avoided with a metal protective coat or even clear nail polish
"
"One of my favourite rings of all time. Classic design and lovely execution.
"
"I love this ring so much. So much. It looks exactly as pictured, it‚Äôs light, and deeply carved, so details won‚Äôt wear off. The head is hollow, so fair warning cause it did make the ring slightly loose on my finger- (you might consider that when choosing size), but all in all it‚Äôs a great ring. My order came about a month after I ordered it, which, considering I got 3 items and it was shipping from Russia to the US is completely reasonable. Would buy from again.
"
"I really like my Viking wolf ring, it is well designed and well made. I would recommend this shop to anyone looking to enhance their Viking garb.
"
"This ring is wonderful, very well detailed and very sturdy. It is made of good quality heavy bronze. I wear it on my index finger and it looks good there. I have received a great number of compliments from people who notice it. 
I recommend this shop to any and all who are interested. Check them out, you will impressed, I was.
"
"Love the ring!! Top notch craftsmanship!
"
"I love this ring!!!
It came quickly, is solid, and super cute. Just wish I could have my acrylic nails again.
"
"Amazing set of rings!
It's a little bit smaller then the other ring I bought from this store but, since you can gently bend it to adjust the size, it fits really well!

I love both the rings I bought from this shop and I'll surely buy again here!
"
"Super cute! Love it! Took quite some time to get here but definitely worth the wait! Thanks much! üôèüèº‚ù£
"
"Not only is Thalia a pleasure, her pieces are exactly as described and wonderfully made. This chain ring provides the perfect amount of fun and edge to spice up any look. I can‚Äôt stop wearing it! Customer service is fantastic, shipping times are quick and I have already purchased more! Thank you!!!!
"
"Very pretty ring. I like that it is flexible. Shipped super fast.
"
"Beautiful, delicate, and it sits beautifully :)
"
"A bit bigger than I expected on my finger but a beautiful ring regardless.
"
"love this ring, very nice
"
"I purchased the necklace in 16in and wanted it to lay right at my collar bone and I got the length perfect. This necklace is so dainty but sparkles and shines so nice and is a very attractive piece to have. I‚Äôm so glad I didn‚Äôt let this item sit in my cart. The price was great and the shipping was very quick. I will be wearing this everyday, it feels strong for me to be able to. The necklace I purchased is the top one (and the bottom one is in 19inches just in case you wanted to see the length difference)
"
"So cute, I wear this size as a bracelet and it‚Äôs comfy and dainty, but gives the perfect amount of bling
"
"i doubled tge chain with another one and it looks very nice, it is shiny and seems quite strong. like it.
"
"I got the 7-inch chain to wear as an anklet and it feels very durable. The texture of the chain helps catch the light well. This is the perfect anklet or bracelet. Thank you so much for the freebie Sara!
"
"Beautiful ring, fits well!
"
 
"I love, love, love my ring! I had my eye on this ring for quite awhile and I‚Äôm so happy I finally purchased it. It arrived very quickly and beautifully wrapped with a thoughtful, hand written note. It is sized perfectly and fits the way I hoped it would.  I love wearing it because the setting is low profile so it doesn‚Äôt catch easily or get knocked around. This is a great ring to wear stacked with other rings. 

Regarding the way this ring looks - WOW it is gorgeous! The color of the amethyst is even prettier in person, especially when the light hits it. The overall look of the ring is striking yet understated. I‚Äôm so happy with my ring that I‚Äôm getting ready to order another one with either a green or blue stone. 

For your reference the stone size I have is 8mm but I think I‚Äôll get a 10mm next time.
"
"This was my second purchase from KyklosJewelry. The black onyx ring is beautiful as expected and it is even nicer with the other ring together! The shipping is so fast in this challenging time, and I am so happy with my rings!!
"
 
"just what I needed, thank you!
"
"Very nice.
"
 
"very pretty ring, especially since i was looking for a trinity ring that is not to bulky! love it
"
"Gorgeous ring, super quick delivery. Xx
"
"Excellent service and perfect item
"
"I did not like the ring, they agreed to refund
"
"The ring was shipped and delivered very quickly! It is so gorgeous and very comfortable! Absolutely love it
"
"Beautiful and simple craft - a ring I can wear with everything and that matches all my other jewellery. Love it. 
Shipping was quick, efficient and it arrived in lovely secure packaging. 
Thank you Daniela!:)
"
"just lovely...thank you..........wish the shipping were a bit faster... but it is another continent!
"
"The item was shipped immediately. It is a nice ring, exactly like the description.
"
"I bought these rings for my mom and I. The rose gold and silver is so cute together! The rings are VERY dainty, more than I thought they would be but they are still very pretty. My mo is going to love it! Thank you!
"
"Beyond happy with this purchase (: I used to have a ring very similar to this one that I bought at a local boutique. But it wasn't as well-made or sturdy. It bent easily and then fell off my finger without noticing it. My new ring from Alari Design is perfect! Very dainty and cute, yet seems as though it will hold up well. Love it! Will order from this shop again in the future.
"
"This ring is absolutely wonderful. It is so pretty, and delicate.  I love the way it looks in person, very true to the photos. Very nicely  packaged, and a really great warranty.  

It arrived sooner than I expected, and it meant a lot to me. It arrived right in time for seeing my BFF off on her move from VA to AZ (she has one too, of course!)

Highly recommend! Thanks Alari!
"
"this is my second purchase from this shop, and i'm just as happy as the first time i bought rings from here. the ring is really delicate and fit perfectly. getting it in the mail today brightened my day immensely.
"
"It is perfect, I loved it so much I immediately ordered another ring from here. The quality is spot on and the shipping was incredibly fast!!!
"
"This is a beautiful ring - it was wrapped exquisitely and arrived very quickly. Delighted! Thank you Sophie x
"
"Lovey packaging, the ring is nice, and a lovely seller. Thanks :)
"
"Ring was stunning and beautifully made - a little large but nothing that we can't solve by resizing! Thank you for being so incredibly helpful & talented üòÅ
"
"Arrivato in 9 giorni, credo a causa delle poste, e del ponte del 2/6.
L'anello √® molto carino, della giusta misura, lavorazione accurata.
La destinataria √® molto contenta!
"
"Gli anelli sono bellissimi, hanno superato le mie aspettative. Le ragazze sono molto cordiali e la spedizione √® stata precisa e puntuale. Far√≤ sicuramente un altro acquisto molto presto.
"
"pessimo, realizzato male e senza alcuna rifinitura. sconsigliatissimo
"
"spedizione velocissima,me lo aspettavo un pochino pi√π pesante ma il prezzo sicuramente sarebbe stato pi√π alto...articolo cmq molto carino
"
"I absolutely love my ring! The pearl is so much prettier in person than in pictures. Catherine was super helpful by sending me some pictures so I could pick the pearl that I wanted. I'm already looking at more pieces from her. Thank you so much Catherine!
"
"Even better then I thought, beautiful ring <3
"
"amazing ring. very beautiful and exactly what i pictured, definitely worth the wait! i‚Äôve only had this for a couple days so i can‚Äôt say much about quality in the long run but so far it seems like it‚Äôs sturdy, no signs of the stone falling out. i wasnt sure about the size when ordering and when i got it i thought it was a little big but it‚Äôs actually the perfect size and i am very happy with it. thank you for your hard work Catherine!
"
"Okay. So I got this right set in silver and it was too small and I want sure about it. The seller really went above and beyond to make me happy. She resized it and sent me an extra band because the one it came with was super thin. It's beautiful! Thank you!!
"
"I love the ring! It is just perfect! The seller is super nice, available and very professional.
At first i ordered the wrong size and - after helping me in understanding the size - she immediately made another one in order to be able to get it on time for an occasion i had.
I strongly recommend this seller. Very nice style and good quality products.
"
"Beautiful ring, the fit was just right.
Arrived very fast and was wrapped so nicely!
Really happy with this purchase, I would recommend this seller/artist.
"
"splendid, gorgeous, fine, elegant, deserves
"
"Ein sehr sch√∂ner Ring, ein ausgesprochen netter und zuvorkommender Kontakt und eine schnelle Lieferung. Alles bestens!!!! Herzlichen Dank.
"
 
"Very delicate tiny stars.  Perfect for stacking with my other rings.  Looks just as pictured.  Love it!  Shipped quickly too!
"
"Perfect for what I needed it for! I have a low-profile, marquis cut engagement ring and have been struggling to find a wedding band. I ordered this to see how the curved band would look, and I‚Äôm sold!
"
"Beautifully but you do need to size up. I usually wear an 11 on my index or thumb but it was perfect for my ring finger. Either way it‚Äôs beautiful. My first purchase from Etsy and definitely not my last especially from this seller.
"
"It's a beautiful dainty silver double ring, I love it!
"
"I received the ring in perfect conditions and surprisingly fast (Thailand - Germany is quiet a way). It is a bit thinner than expected but very subtile and looks very elegant
"
"I love it so much, I am gonna buy another one!
"
"Very cute ring ! ! !
"
"I had questions about sizing as I intended to stack it with another band ring. I followed John‚Äôs advice and it was spot on. Gorgeous trinity ring. It rolls beautifully and looks very elegant next to my diamond band. Its perfect. üòç I love it!
"
"This is, first of all, a beautiful ring, even more attractive than the photos show. It‚Äôs smooth as glass and feels good on my hand. 
I wasn‚Äôt sure what size to order, and when I ordered the wrong size first, the owner was so helpful - his suggestion for the second ring size was perfect. Now I just need to return the first ring - if I had someone to give it to, it would be a lovely gift. 
My ring came in the agreed amount of time (which was quick) and nicely packaged. 
I‚Äôll definitely order from this shop again.
"
"Had a bit of a disaster with these! Haha. The rings are lovely- took about 3 weeks to arrive from US to UK and I was so excited! When they came they are beautiful and really good quality. However I was so excited I was trying them on every finger, which caused my ringer to get a bit swollen from taking it on and off so many times....which made the ring get stuck :( I tried for hours to get it off but eventually they had to be cut off my finger after about 8 hours as my finger got even more swollen (my fault, not the rings). I‚Äôm so upset because they are so lovely and I never got to wear them properly!!! Anyway 5 stars because that‚Äôs my own fault, and can vouch that the rings are good quality because they were difficult to cut through lol! Don‚Äôt let this put you off, they‚Äôre beautiful rings just don‚Äôt be silly like me!! ü§£üò´üò≠
"
"Just received my parcel today, it came in a cute little box. 
It‚Äôs a very pretty ring, looks exactly the same as the picture. Seller was helpful and knowledgeable. 
Thank you so much! üòä
"
"LOVE it. Thank you, so much. Very special to me, and I will always treasure it. The picture is of my mustang, Rhiannon (named after the Welsh horse goddess).
"
"This is another of my favorite things I have found on Etsy.  I live in this ring. So well done and very intricate!!  Fast shipping, too!!
"
"Perfect! MRD keeps making perfect horse jewelry! Shipping was quick too! I wear even the most delicate looking piece (the hungry horse necklace) daily since I received it, and it still is in like new shape! I don't have to take them off, or the rings, to do any horse chores, riding or training (i just tuck yhe necklaces under my shirt). THAT is my definition of perfect horsey jewelry!
"
"my new favorite.  stacked on the same silver ring n many compliments!
"
"I am in love! Can't express how obsessed I am with this set of rings. Perfection!!!
"
"Absolutely great communication from the seller. The quality of the ring is amazing, love it so much. Highly recommended.
"
"Love my ring! So unique and fits perfect. Thank you
"
"This is gorgeous, as described, shipped quickly, and fits perfectly

"
"Love love love it!!! Definitely worth the wait for shipping to me.
"
"I LOVE this ring! I wear it everyday! It‚Äôs so pretty, delicate, comfortable to wear and oh so versatile!  I can wear it in so many ways to create different looks (wish I could post lots of pics on here). I can wear it with the X in the front, the X in the back or even the X on the side and I can also insert another ring in the middle which is so cool! (As shown on the attached picture with my engagement ring).
I love Joe‚Äôs craftsmanship, impeccable customer service, advice and sweetness!
Not my first purchase and it won‚Äôt be my last!
"
"Absolutely lovely, I paired this ring with another Etsy purchase to create a memory ring for my husband who passed 8 years ago on Valentines Day.  This ring means more than you know.  Gratefully, Courtney G.
"
"Beautiful work on this x-ring (thumb). The hammered detail is perfect. I‚Äôm really liking this combination of rings (all from this shop except the bottom ring on the middle finger). I love that I can wear them all with my ring purchased in a London, UK. Thank you!
"
"I can‚Äôt begin to describe how much I LOVE this ring!!! It‚Äôs absolutely gorgeous and exactly what I wanted to match with my other rings!! I love that the seller messaged me about when he was making the ring and when it would be shipped out to me!! That‚Äôs the best customer service I‚Äôve experienced when it come to jewelry!!! I will definitely be recommending Irresistibly Minimal to all of my friends!!!

"
"Minimal and pretty, I really love it!
"
"Exactly as described. I got the smaller size to wear as a pinky ring and it's perfect since it adjusts easily too. Love!
"
"I like how the colour of the ring stood out and complimenty skin. Size is just nice too! I searched for ways on how to measure ring size on Google and it works!
"
"I waited a bit to review this ring because I wanted to make sure it didn't tarnish, I've worn it for a while now and it hasn't tarnished. Beautiful and arrived really fast. Will be ordering again for sure. Thank you :)

"The rose gold Libra ring I received came extremely fast and is beautiful! The fact that it's adjustable is even better because I can wear it on any finger. I will definitely be ordering again. :)
"
"I LOVE this design! I purchased for my best friend as a gift. It was sent straight to her home. I selected the gift wrap option and the personalized note too. She didn‚Äôt show me what the gift wrap looked like but it was Quick delivery, &she loved the presentation and loved the ring ! Thanks so much!!! If you get this in a sterling silver I‚Äôll totally buy one myself ! üòÜ
"
"Literally OBSESSED with this ring! It would look great alone or paired with similar colored rings!
"
"I got this as my own present. I love that this is adjustable and the rose gold makes it so unique. Comfortable , simple, and beautiful.

"Great set of rings. Special and absolutely beautiful, everybody notice it and I get so many compliments about it. Gives a boho chic look, I love it. 
Shipping was really fast and as usual in this shop, even the packaging is super cute. 

On a sidenote though, I wore it only a few times and I noticed a slight change of color on the inside of the rings as well as light greenish stains left on my fingers. Not sure if it's because I live in a tropical country and the humidity is really high, I just hope it won't get completely tarnished. If anyone has a good tip to preserve the color and keep it shining, let me know !

PS : Only 3 rings on the pic because that's what I'm wearing today, but the 8 rings are all equally beautiful :)
"
"So happy with these! I have very tiny and slim, little fingers, and so find buying rings difficulty as no where would cater for my pixie hands. When I saw that these were adjustable I was so happy, they were too pretty to pass up. They came in time and in a lovely little bag. And for the first time, they all fit! I was able to adjust the more dainty rings to fit my pinky fingers, that never happens. They‚Äôre all so lovely and am so happy with them. Thank you.
"
"Love these rings. I ordered 8 and put 4 on each hand. I have manly hands from genetics and these make them look a little more feminine!! Thanks!!
"
"I love these rings! They're my new everyday jewelry!
"
"Perfect fit! Love this ring, it's so me!

"
"Thank you, I love it so much! It‚Äôs so daintyüíï
"
"Awesome ring and I love that they actually size it for so it's not the ""adjustable"" kind that fall off easily. I sent my ring sizes and it fits perfectly for the finger I intended and I wear it with my ganesh ring. Great find!
"
"It's a very nice  chain ring.. I just thought the rings would be a lil thick how I want it but overall I like it
"
"I got the set of 2, super thin smooth & twist gold rings. I am in love with them! I paired my solitaire engagement ring with these and they look super beautiful together. Thank you Joe. I prefer these  bands than my actual wedding ring. They're simply beautiful.
"
"These rings are incredibly beautiful! I am so amazed with the quality and i'm so happy I ordered them! I am going to wear these on my wedding day alongside my engagement ring. I am really impressed with the incredible customer service. The owner contacted me very quickly after I ordered to give me an update and when I received my order it included a hand written note. It was such a nice touch. I highly recommend this shop and I know I will be ordering more items soon. Thank you!
"
"I highly recommend buying from this shop! My rings came really fast and the fit was a bit big so I messaged Joe and he resized it without any additional costs! I‚Äôm super happy with my purchase :)

"Love these so much!! I wear them everyday on the finger next to my love ring!!

"Es para un regalo. Bien envuelto. Le van a encantar igual que a mi... ahorrando para comprar seguro. Gracias.

Muy contenta con Ainos, volver√© a comprarle seguro!
"
"Beautiful and elegant...I love my ring! Exactly as described. Thanks so much!! üíó
"
 
"I cant say enough great things about this ring. The pictures in the reviews do not do justice to the beautiful herkimer diamond. This seller is amazing! They sent my order on time eventhough and listened to all of the particular things I wanted done to the ring (specific size, orientation and color). I got this as a promise ring for my girlfriend and she is in love with it!
"
"I loved the look of the rings since I saw them in the pictures, but I loved them even more when I received them and saw them in person, they‚Äôre so well made and the quality is great .Thank you Camila for the stunning work you do. Will definitely come back for more!
"
"Beautiful work!!!!!! I bought this ring for my best friend. She really loved it and I do too!!!! I had great contact with the owner who did everything for me to have the gift ready and shipped on time for Christmas. Thank you again!

J'ai achet√© cette magnifique bague pour ma meilleure amie! Elle l'a ador√©e et moi aussi! Je remercie sinc√®rement MerCurios pour la qualit√© du service et la rapidit√© d'envoi.
"
"Such a beautifully crafted piece! I get compliments constantly. The shipping was exactly when promised/expected. The package came with lots of thoughtful, fun ‚Äúextras‚Äù. So glad I found this shop. Waiting on my next piece to arrive!
"
"Schade Versand hat √ºber  4 Wochen gedauert
"
"Perfect ! I like it !
"
"The rings are absolutely stunning!! They were a bit too small and she was kind enough to resize them for me once I sent it back. LOVE this shop!
"
"redelijk; er was nog wat onduidelijkheid over de maat. de correspondentie verliep prima tot op het moment van ontvangst.
er is nl nogal twijfel of de ring van het toegezegde goud is. hij lijkt nl meer van koper/ messing te zijn. ik ga dit uitzoeken bij een plaatselijke juwelier. mocht het geen goud zijn, zoals toegezegd, dan is de ring erg duur!
nadat er uitleg kwam v friedasophie over de gebruikte materialen voor de ring ben ik erg tevreden en blij met de mooie ring.
"
"Love this ring!  Exactly as shown - very happy!
"
"Really dainty and pretty! I'll be wearing this everyday!
"
"This item was great! It was made quickly and beautifully and I received it in two weeks. (One for making, one for sending). The ring is very beautiful. Also the shop was very helpful and gave me updates of how it was coming along
"
"This silver ring is really wonderfully crafted and one of a kind indeed. It was a present for my wife and she just loves it. Shipping was perfectly in time, very pleasant and friendly contact, too. Couldn't be better actually.
"
"Mein ""Kalma-Schmuckst√ºck"" macht mich jeden Tag gl√ºcklich :-) Die Ohrringe sind sehr besonders gearbeitet und geben mir das gute Gef√ºhl eines wertigen Schmuckst√ºcks. Besonders gef√§llt mir, dass es sich um ein Unikat handelt, das von Katrin mit viel Hingabe, Kreativit√§t und Liebe zum Detail gefertigt wurde. Ich werde st√§ndig auf die Ohrringe angesprochen und bin stolz, ""meine"" Goldschmiedin (Geheimtipp!!!) als Designerin und Produzentin angeben zu k√∂nnen. Mit dem Versand klappte alles ganz unkompliziert, die Kommunikation mit Katrin l√§uft super. Ich kann Kalma jedem empfehlen, der Wert auf individuellen, sehr besonderen Schmuck legt.
"

"Absolutely gorgeous ring! Exactly what I was looking for and I couldn't love it more! Shipping is fast. I love Heather's taste for the beautiful and simple collection :) will definitely come back.
"
"Exactly what I was looking for! Great attention to detail and true to size. The rings are welded together so they don't move around. Can't wait to wear this I am so happy with this purchase. Seller was responsive and shipping was decently quick to Ontario, Canada.
"
"The ring is perfect! Got a size 7 and it‚Äôs true to size. I absolutely love it! Fast shipping too!
"
"Stunning. Couldn‚Äôt believe how fast I got this ring and it looks so beautiful no matter what fingers I wear it on. Thank you for this beautiful ring!!
"
"I received my beautiful ring when the seller (Nikoletta) said I would. It is a stunning ring, a gorgeous hot pink colour & as lovely (if not more lovely) as it looks in the picture. It fits me perfectly & the packaging was beautiful too. All communications with Nikoletta were very easy. I highly recommend this shop & seller. Thanks Nikoletta.
"
"I'm very happy with my (2nd) purchase from Nikoletta. My ring is as lovely as the picture & very well made. Shipping was fast & I like the fact that this ring is one of a kind. Thanks very much Nikoletta.
"
"The earrings are beautiful and they were shipped promptly and well packaged. I am so glad I ordered them!
"
"I love floral and organic shapes, so I immediately fell in love with these olive leaf earrings. Beautiful matte texture. Nicoletta was so helpful when I lost one and enclosed a very useful pair of stoppers with my next order. Thank you Nicoletta! I wear my olive leaves frequently and like them very much. Perfect for every occasion.
"
"So totally gorgeous!! I love it!

Really comfortable to wear as well.

Many many thanks xx
"
"It is truly beautiful. Was worry about not going to be confortable but is perfect
"
"I love it.  It took too long to receive.  When I asked the seller, he was nice.  I will buy again.
"
"awesome ring, fits perfect. Thank you
"
"Very good quality and craftmanship. Fell out of my fingers many times but still looking as good as new! I made the mistake of ordering the wrong size but found ways to fix it myself. Tip for first-time buyers like me: get your ring finger measured by a professional at a jewellery store, as what Roy had advised me, before ordering online. Am looking forward to more of your collections Roy!
"
"This ring was sent to me super quickly and I absolutely love it, I wear it almost every day!
"
"Beautiful ring, exactly as pictured, sized perfectly. This is my 4th purchase from this shop, it‚Äôs excellent value .

"
"Beautiful ring, I wear it often and wash my hands constantly with it on and it's actually retained it's finish and color more than an expensive designer ring. Really great quality especially for the reasonable price.
"
"Super produit de qualit√©

Le Vendeur est disponible et tr√®s agr√©able 
La finesse du produit est vraiment remarquable

"Working with this shop was a great experience! They are prompt, had good communication, the ring is beautiful and exactly as described, and the box it came in was very high quality. 

I will definitely purchase from them again ü•∞
"
"Absolutely gorgeous. Shipping to the US was incredibly fast!
"
"Beautiful ring and excellent service- thanks!
"
"The picture doesn't really do this piece justice. It is really beautiful. The stones are natural. They're a deep ruby red in my purchase. You won't go wrong purchasing from Maya Studio!

"THANK YOU. I LOVE IT VERY MUCH. AYELET
"
"My rings finally arrived and they are beautiful.
"
"Absolutely beautiful well-crafted rings thank you!
"
 
"The ring looks exactly like the photo and feels well-made and high-quality. I thought I was ordering only one ring and received two which was a pleasant surprise!
"
"Quick shipping! The ring is great. I wore it today for the first time and got various complements. Size of the ring is very easy to adjust.
"
"Came even faster than it said, such a beautiful ring! I was not disappointed at all! And you can fit it to your size. :)
"
"Beautiful ring!  The time she takes in presentation and packaging is amazing as well!  This artisan cares about her customers!  Thank you so much
"
"LOVE this!!!! Thank you!!!
"
"This ring is just so much more than I could put into words! It should really cost more than it does. I got it so quickly and I got the wrong size (my fault) but he was willing to resize it for me and even sent it back really fast. I will be purchasing from here again! Amazing talent!
"
"I LOVE THIS. However, I broke my heart the same
Moment I broke my ring. Three days after I received it. I'm going to make it a pendant for a necklace. No worries! So beautiful and amazingly crafted :)
"
"This (not so) little octopus is gorgeous! It's a little snug so I would recommend requesting a half size up. It's even better than the picture.
"
"Gorgeous work!  Such beautiful quality.
"
"This ring is beautiful and I was very impressed by the craftsmanship. I have worn two finger rings before, and none have been as comfortable as this one.

The items are made to order, so shipping does take longer, but it‚Äôs worth the wait. I also ordered a custom chevron ring, and the shop included a 2nd chevron ring for no additional charge. They even discounted my shipping charges and included a nice handwritten note with my package. 

Thank you for the incredible customer service and gorgeous jewelry! I can‚Äôt wait to order additional pieces!
"
"This is my most favorite ring ever! I get a ton of compliments on it.  LOVE it!!!
"
"I love this ring. It's gorgeous, and still kind of delicate. It does overlap your other fingers a bit but I don't mind, just a heads up in case you mind. Thank you!
"
"I LOVE IT! It looks stunning on and the workmanship is impeccable. Great communication and Julie is friendly and helpful. Will definitely purchase from Femme Mechanique again. Highly recommended
"

"I cant stop looking at it, I am so happy with this set of rings. The rings turned out more small/delicate than I expected from what I saw in the pictures, but in a good way. They look so refined and delicate. Shipping was also amazingly fast, took about 10 days after buying and already found it in the mail. Thank you so much, keep up this work, it really is amazing!
"
"exactly what i was expecting simple and cute so happy to finally have a ring that‚Äôs my birthstone
"
"Elegant and delicate! Recommended!
"
"Beautiful ring. Bought as a gift. Came in a box and lovely gift bag. Amazing for the price. I will be returning
"
"Very quick delivery and the ring is lovely ‚ô•Ô∏è
"
"Lovely ring. Fast delivery. Very happy.
"
"so so cute!! i ordered again because i loved them! delivery was super fast and really good quality necklaces!
"
 
"Very delicate tiny stars.  Perfect for stacking with my other rings.  Looks just as pictured.  Love it!  Shipped quickly too!
"
"Perfect for what I needed it for! I have a low-profile, marquis cut engagement ring and have been struggling to find a wedding band. I ordered this to see how the curved band would look, and I‚Äôm sold!
"
"Beautifully but you do need to size up. I usually wear an 11 on my index or thumb but it was perfect for my ring finger. Either way it‚Äôs beautiful. My first purchase from Etsy and definitely not my last especially from this seller.
"
"I‚Äôm so happy w the way my earrings + ear climber turned out. They added the perfect amount of edge to my wedding look.
"
"The ring took a while to get here, but that‚Äôs to be expected when it‚Äôs coming from so far away! The ring is amazing, the stone is flawless, the fit is perfect and it came in the most beautiful wooden box! My boyfriend is thrilled!
"
"Such gorgeous earrings.perfect for my dress on our daughters wedding day. Love love..thank you
"
"Absolutely gorgeous! I was afraid to buy online but it is a true masterpiece. Thank you so much! Definitely will order something from your store in the future.
"
"Shipped on time, seamless ordering, and I love this ring. It's so much fun to fiddle with but is really subtle and lovely, and can easily be worn in any setting and at any level of dressiness. I am honestly considering getting more, to wear on other fingers, I am such a fan. Probably my favorite of all my fidget rings. Thank you!!

The only thing I would note for other buyers reading this: size up a little more than you think you need. As I'm finding with may fidget rings, the multiple rings can make the opening smaller than the listed size, which I tried to account for but should have gone up even more, I think. This one (7.25) fits best I would say on my size 6.5 finger across all temperatures.
"
"I love this ring. It feels so substantial on my finger - not heavy but you can feel the quality. This is exactly what I‚Äôve been looking for!!!
"
"this is a duplicate purchase, due to weight loss (!!!), but i just couldn't be without this ring. it is one of my favorite pieces.
"
"I bought this a month ago and I'm in love with the design. The rings spin well, but I find myself rolling them over each other up and down my finger more often. Wonderful for my attention and anxiety issues, and not as obvious as a previous spinner ring I had. I play with it constantly, probably more than I realize, and only take it off to shower but it seems to be holding up well. Large sizing also a plus. So, so happy with it and will come back if I'm ever interested in something else!
"
"Stunning! I wanted a comfortable silicone ring but something prettier than a simple band and this is it! I will be buying more!!
"
"Absolutely gorgeous and was packaged exquisitely! I've already placed another order!!
"
"really nice, good, thank you
"
"These rings were exactly what I was looking for. Silicone rings with a little bit of ‚Äòextra‚Äô! 

They are very very comfortable and I enjoy the E-W setting of the marquis stones which are beautiful. They are clear, they sparkle and they are well set which is what I want in a ring made with Swarovski stones. 

The setting feels sturdy and the prongs are tight! The band is silicone but feels slightly more stiff which feels like more of a reinforcement as opposed to a hinderance for this ring. 

Excellent ring. Excellent quality. Will buy again!
"
"I received my beautiful ring when the seller (Nikoletta) said I would. It is a stunning ring, a gorgeous hot pink colour & as lovely (if not more lovely) as it looks in the picture. It fits me perfectly & the packaging was beautiful too. All communications with Nikoletta were very easy. I highly recommend this shop & seller. Thanks Nikoletta.
"
"I'm very happy with my (2nd) purchase from Nikoletta. My ring is as lovely as the picture & very well made. Shipping was fast & I like the fact that this ring is one of a kind. Thanks very much Nikoletta.
"
"Absolutely love the ring I purchased! Bought it as a birthday gift for my best friend and she is in love with it. Stunning details and outstanding quality! Definitely recommend to everyone. ‚ò∫Ô∏è
"
"I love floral and organic shapes, so I immediately fell in love with these olive leaf earrings. Beautiful matte texture. Nicoletta was so helpful when I lost one and enclosed a very useful pair of stoppers with my next order. Thank you Nicoletta! I wear my olive leaves frequently and like them very much. Perfect for every occasion.
"
"Okay. So I got this right set in silver and it was too small and I want sure about it. The seller really went above and beyond to make me happy. She resized it and sent me an extra band because the one it came with was super thin. It's beautiful! Thank you!!
"
"To say that I‚Äôm obsessed is an understatement... truly blown away.
"
"amazing ring. very beautiful and exactly what i pictured, definitely worth the wait! i‚Äôve only had this for a couple days so i can‚Äôt say much about quality in the long run but so far it seems like it‚Äôs sturdy, no signs of the stone falling out. i wasnt sure about the size when ordering and when i got it i thought it was a little big but it‚Äôs actually the perfect size and i am very happy with it. thank you for your hard work Catherine!
"
"I absolutely love my ring! The pearl is so much prettier in person than in pictures. Catherine was super helpful by sending me some pictures so I could pick the pearl that I wanted. I'm already looking at more pieces from her. Thank you so much Catherine!
"
"I just recieved the ring yesterday! A little small than what I thought. Nonetheless, beautiful!
"
"This ring is great, fast shipping considering I live in California. Comfortable to wear and goes with everything!
"
"LOVE this ring! came with a lovely note ~ thank you and I will enjoy and appreciate the handwork every time I wear it!
"
"Perfect transaction! This ring is so beautiful and especially! I wear it every day. A great handwork! Highly recommended!
"
"I purchased the coiled 18k yellow gold ring. I special ordered the ring size to 12 US. Mrs. Elke Flinkert handled my ordered directly. It was ready within a few days and then shipped to my location. There were no shipping issues.

When the ring arrived I was pleasantly surprised. It looked just as beautiful as in the photos. The ring was perfectly tailored my mother measurements (early mother‚Äôs day present). It delivers a simple, delicate, and graceful design.

Mr. Flinkert maintained constant communication through the entire process and provided tracking information immediately after shipping.

100% Happy!
"
"The ring is exquisite, exactly how I imagined it would be. The service was beyond my imagination. I have made a measuring mistake and had to return the ring. Elke told me I could just send it back and she would manufacture another ring for me, without extra charge :-) Thank you so much!!!
"
"It‚Äôs as real as the given photos.
It‚Äôs a simple and yet loud ring, it can be a statement ring.
The customer service is excellent and the questions are replied quickly.  Elke is very easy to work with, easily granted my request.
Very happy with the purchase!
"
"Der sehr h√ºbsche Wickelring wurde schnell geliefert. Meine speziellen Anfertigungsw√ºnsche wurden umgesetzt und die Kommunikation verlief extra-sympathisch. Danke!
"
"Ho preso gli anelli sovrapponibili e devo dire che sono davvero belli, hanno anche un peso che mi piace perch√© mi fa ""sentire"" il valore di quello che indosso üôÇ (sottolineo per√≤ che non sono pesanti!) L'anello √® arrivato in una confezione deliziosa con una nota da Giulia, quindi perfetto anche per un regalo a qualcuno! üòä
C'√® stato un piccolo disguido con l'ordine non dipeso da Giulia e devo dire che lei √® stata perfetta nel gestire tutto con grande efficienza e gentilezza. Lo voglio sottolineare perch√© gli inconvenienti possono capitare ed √® come vengono gestiti che dimostra il valore di chi c'√® dall'altra parte. Cinque ‚≠ê strameritate, sia per il prodotto sia per il venditore. Consigliatissimo! üòä
"
"Gli anelli sono perfetti, come in foto, la misura √® perfetta. La consegna prima di quanto credessi! Gli anelli sono molto belli anche da portare singolarmente!
"
"Anello/i assolutamente magnifici.
Inoltre la gentilezza e la disponibilit√† di Giulia ti fanno godere di pi√π il gioiello che indossi perch√© sai che dietro c'√® qualcuno che lavora bene, seriamente e che tratta i clienti con i guanti! <3
"
"Questa √® in assoluto la mia collana migliore! Giulia √® una bravissima artigiana, molto attenta al cliente. S√¨ √® mostrata subito disponibile, mi ha tolto ogni mio dubbio e ha realizzato il gioiello dei miei sogni! √à veramente bello avere un gioiello unico e soprattutto personalizzato. In questo caso ho fatto incidere con la scrittura di mio padre una parte di una lettera che mi scrisse tempo fa... Dal vivo fa emozionare e non rende quanto la foto. 
Grazie Giulia per aver realizzato questa collana per me e soprattutto grazie per esserti interessata sull'arrivo del pacco... Dimostri di essere una grande artista e soprattutto una brava persona, interessata al cliente. Sicuramente mi affider√≤ di nuovo a te :)
"
"I love my ring and this shop! They were so responsive and able to answer all of my questions and the ring absolutely surpassed my expectations. I struggled to find a wedding band to match my engagement ring and this works so well! I‚Äôm so happy :)
"
"Exactly what I needed! Perfect band for my platinum engagement ring.
"
"Exactly what I wanted! Fits perfect. Very pretty and dainty ring that I am using a guard ring not a spacer for when my fingers aren't swollen; that way my engagement ring doesn't slip off. There are markings inside the band but it is so small it is hard to see with naked eye.
"
"I am impressed with the quality, production speed, and most importantly how well she was able to get it to fit my engagement ring off of only pictures. This is a great option for anyone with a ring that will not fit a standard wedding band. I highly recommend this shop and I love my ring.
"
"This is my second time buying from LeCubicule and I am so happy with my rings. This one is delicate and expertly constructed. It fits perfectly and is a beautiful add to my collection. Shipping was speedy and the cute little tin was a great touch! I will definitely be buying more of my wish list from Joelle!
"
"Beautiful! I love how cute and simple this ring looks. 

I might size down if you're in between sizes. I ordered a 5 but it fits more like a 5 1/4 or 5 1/2. I just wear it on my middle finger though and it fits perfectly :)
"
"Love it so much! It was exactly what I was looking for. They warned me that it would take a while to prepare since every item was made to order, but it reached me faster than expected. I wear it all the time! The only minor drawback is that the joints are slightly visible for the yellow gold filled version, but I love it so much, it doesn't bother me. 10/10 would buy from LeCubicule again!
"
"Magnifique, je l‚Äôadore!!! Elle n‚Äôa plus quitt√© mes doigts depuis que je l‚Äôai re√ßue! :-))) Un beau classique minimaliste et ind√©modable!
"
"Beautiful lightweight ring. It gives a gothic vampire feel. Love the shape of a gothic window. Great package. Love the coffin box it came in. Arrived fast.
"
"Just perfect and fast shipping!
"
 
"Got this for my iPhone SE 2020 and absolutely love it! I was moving to a different state at the time I purchased it and had a major time crunch as a result. Sorcere was fully supportive of this and helped make sure the case was shipped to me before I had to leave. Great customer service! Thank you, Raven!

As for the case itself, at least for the iPhone SE 2020, I can confirm the Apple logo is completely covered by the castle. I have the red iPhone, so like other reviewers have said, it creates an amazing blood moon effect. I've gotten quite a few compliments about the case, too, with people asking where I got it. The case is thin, so fits comfortably in my hand, but not so thin that the phone isn't protected. The phone feels safe with it on. To anyone who loves the things that go bump in the night, I highly recommend this!
"
"Incredibly gorgeous! It‚Äôs so unique and dainty. I‚Äôm over the moon happy ‚ù§Ô∏è
"
"Photos don‚Äôt do this necklace justice! Very beautiful and I am in love this it!
"
"Beyond stunning!!I adore this shop! The quality is so high, and it looks so pretty. The seller is really accommodating and helpful. The whole shopping experience was fantastic.I would definitely shop here again and can‚Äôt recommend this shop enough. Thank you!
"
"Really lovely piece. The only thing that soured it was the amount of tax I had to pay in the uk. An extra ¬£17! Please keep this in mind if it applies to you!
"
"Love these!  Very lightweight and easy to adjust.  A great addition for my Renn Faire outfit.
"
"I bought two sets of these claws, and they weren't kidding about them being long! They're going to be a perfect addition to the Windigo costume I have planned!

Thank you again for such a great product. ((Life was a bit hectic; so I'm sorry this review is so late!))
"
"It is SO amazing! Love the quality. Shipped out crazy fast.
"

"OMG! I am lost of words! They are so pretty! Can‚Äôt wait to wear them! Wish I was able to put one on my thumbs but it‚Äôs no big deal!
"
"it came soooo fast and it‚Äôs very cute! the sizes vary ( im normally a size 7 ) and some fit my pinkies and other fit my thumbs. love love love üòÅ
"
"Gorgeous rings. I love all the designs. One thing I will say is maybe stay away from these if you are a ring size 8 (like me) or up. Only 2 of the rings fit my fingers fully. Other than that if I had small fingers I would wear this set everyday.
"
"These are really pretty! They were on the big side and I can usually fit size US size 6/7 and most were big on me. But other than that the rings are so cute!
"
"This ring is even more beautiful in person, love the adjustability of it would truly recommend you to try it !! In love .
"
"Very cute! I got the silver one and it's perfect! It feels dainty yet sturdy enough to adjust without feeling like I'll break it. May get the rose gold one for an upcoming wedding!
"
"Wow, just wow. The pictures don't do any justice. This ring is just gorgeous! Arrived quickly, and is better than expected! Thank you!
"
"I'm really happy with this. It's very beautiful and dainty. I'm so afraid to wear it out because I don't want to ruin it. Fit perfectly without even having to adjust it. Would definitely recommend!
"
 
 
 
 
"The rings were too big for me, but they‚Äôre so cute! They look just like the photos, and the seller was very easy to communicate with !
"
"Amazingly fast shipping and they are so pretty!!
"
"It was very pretty and just like I wanted it. It came two days earlier than expected date. I would definitely buy from here again!
"
"Rings fit and were very pretty. The packaging was cute & it shipped very fast!
"
"BEYOND happy!! I am so in love with my new ring. It‚Äôs exactly what I wanted. I actually made a slight change to my order and they were in touch with me within minutes and so kind! I highly recommend purchasing from Caitlyn Minimalist. Also, the packaging is so cute as well. Just all very professional, neat, simple and beautiful. Completely exceeded my expectations and now I have a piece of jewelry I will love forever.
"
"I bought this ring to stack with a tiara ring. It turned out so beautiful!
"
"I just got my ring today and I love it! It‚Äôs small and dainty, the numbers on it are perfect, and it‚Äôs exactly like the description. I just ordered two more to stack them with it!!
"
"It‚Äôs so cute :) really great quality and super adorable too!! Took about 3 weeks but I‚Äôm not even mad about that! Totally worth it (: I had questions and she responded super quick and was very kind !
"
"These rings are super adorable. They are light weight. You can also adjust the rings to your size which is my favorite part about these rings. Hard for me to find simple beautiful rings that can adjust. I‚Äôm very happy with my purchase.
"
"Rings are super cute. Shipped and arrived quickly. Only problem is the twists when doing your hair they get caught. I love them though. Especially since i am
Just trying out the style i love that thej are adjustable.
"
"Love it! i have really skinny fingers(i wear a size 6 for my pointer finger) so i did have to adjust it a lot. shipping didn‚Äôt take too long :)
"
"Love them! Didn‚Äôt realize they were sizable.
"
"Gorgeous! Sadly I ordered the wrong sizes. I underestimated how small my fingers actually are. Regardless, these rings and the seller are perfection. Highly suggest this seller. Great communication. I will certainly be a repeating customer.
"
"I love this ring! I got 6 and absolutely love them! When I had a question, he got back to me in a decent time frame and was very polite. I will be ordering from here again, eventually.
"
"Just perfect !!! I‚Äôm obsessed !!
"
"I love these rings! I haven't taken them off since I got them.
"
"The seller was extremely helpful and shipped the product as quickly as she could. It arrived much faster than I thought, and she kept me updated on the progress of the order the entire way.
"
 
"I ordered the Gold tone ring.  It‚Äôs exactly what I was looking for.   Cute ring.   It took 4 weeks before I received the ring.  But it was worth the wait
"
"Beautiful! I just love it! So cute and dainty just like I wanted! So pretty and will definitely look to this shop for more jewelry! She was also very great with communication. Told me exactly what was going to happen and when with shipping! Thank you!!
"
"From the fianc√©:
 
I found Lena on Etsy several years ago while browsing for jewelry, and instantly fell in love with her beautiful rings. Even before dating my now-fianc√©, I dreamily ‚Äúfavorited‚Äù this emerald engagement ring, thinking that someday I‚Äôd be engaged to the love of my life with this ring on my finger. I can‚Äôt believe that day has finally come! It is even more beautiful in-person and I couldn‚Äôt be happier with Lena‚Äôs craftsmanship! Most importantly, the ring has special significance to me knowing that it was handmade in Israel where I was born, spent the first five years of my life, and still visit to see family. Thank you, Lena, for being a part of this memorable time in our lives!
"
"I can‚Äôt stop staring at my new engagement ring! Honestly it‚Äôs one of the prettiest rings I‚Äôve ever seen. My fianc√© is very proud of it and I‚Äôm a very happy fianc√©e. He says his favorite part is how much I love it. Lena was amazing and patient answering all our questions about fitting it with wedding bands we had from my grandma. She even gave us a little sneak video to help with our excitement (though to be honest it was all my excitement)!  Shipping was incredibly fast! I hear nothing but compliments when people notice my ring!
"
"Love love love love love. The top photo shows the contrast in direct sunlight, and the bottom is inside. Depending on the lighting the grey will be more pronounced. (The colors seen in the bottom photo are from a stained glass window reflecting nearby!) I absolutely love this ring and am so glad we chose to order from Lena. She answered any and every question I had and the ring took only 3 days to arrive once shipped. After spending weeks looking for a salt and pepper diamond, I was thrilled to come across this listing. If you are even considering a salt and pepper diamond, do not hesitate to inquire about this beauty!
"
"So this is my second engagement ring, we got it to match my fianc√©‚Äôs wedding band since his is grey/black with black diamonds + rose gold trim. It‚Äôs so beautiful in person and people love it! 
I put a photo of the 2 ct. salt and pepper ring with rose gold alongside my original ring (not from etsy) which is a .65 center white diamond for comparison. My ring size is a 3.5. The seller was very nice and sent me a video and photo of the diamond she would use.
"
"I love this little bumble bee ring so much I bought it twice! (My first one broke due to my job) I love him so much and will definitely buy from this shop again. I wear him everyday and he is the cutest!
"
"I‚Äôm in love. I sell nail strips for a living and needed some small rings. My daughter gifted this one for my birthday. I adore it. It‚Äôs super dainty and is perfect fit. I love that it looks good no matter how I turn my hands so I don‚Äôt need to flip it for my nailfies. It took a minute to ship by seller was quick to respond and keep me informed. Worth the wait. Going to be buying more.
"
"Love it! So dainty and cute. I have fat fingers; this is a size 10 and fits great.
"
"Love love love the ring ! Only downer for me is that it likes to snag on my blankets - the small little legs and antenna catch everything üò≠ I just don't wear it as one of my daily rings and only wear it when I go out and about - overall amazing ring !!
"
"Love these delicate but badass rings!  I have larger fingers (size 8 on my ring finger) so these are all midi rings (although i can wear them on my pinky if I want), but I ADORE them.  Edgy and feminine.
"
"I love these rings. When I received them I was one short, but the seller sent me out a ring as soon as she received my message about it. I tend to wear three of the rings at a time as all together they can look a bit overwhelming (but that's just preference). I really love wearing them üòç
"
"Love them ! I might lose some but for the price I am totally fine with it.

Maybe not for every type of fingers. My thumb is too big for it and it's no that comfortable. But for all other fingers perfect !
"
"These rings are amazing, I wear them multiple times a week. You can alternate the size, so they fit even my quite chubby fingers. ;)

Costumer care was fast, personalized and lovely. I couldn't ask for better! :)
"
"The seller was very communicative and helpful. The ring is beautiful. I love the simplicity of it. I should have ordered about 2 sizes smaller üòÇ but that‚Äôs on me and nothing to do with the item itself or the seller. Beautiful product and fast shipping overall!
"
"It‚Äôs here! Thank you! Now my ring collection is complete. It‚Äôs just beautiful!
"
"I have been looking at this style of ring for a while.  Some of the styles were too thick of metal and too big of a circle.  I LOVE this ring.  It is a delicate, hammered, just the right size ring for me.  I am wearing it on my index finger.  I  ordered a size 7 and that is what I got.  It fits beautifully.  I didn't realize it was made in Cyprus.  Wonderful global find.
"
"My new favorite accessory! I‚Äôve had the ring on for a couple weeks now. i never take it off and it‚Äôs still beautiful!
"
"I wear this everyday as a midi ring. LOVE my ring. Thank you!
"
"Absolutely love!!! Fits perfect too. (Size 7)
"
"üòçüòçüòç
"
"Love this ring, perfect width very dainty and good quality!
"
"Adoro questi anelli, la consegna √® stata puntuale e in una bella scatola di legno.. Sono davvero ben realizzati e acquister√≤ sicuramente in futuro! Grazie Riccardo per lo splendido lavoro!

"I love love love my rings, they came packaged so adorbable and very secure , shipping time was not long at all , I can't wait to wear my rings this summer , will most likely order some more as now I know the quality is great. Thank you so much. I recommend this seller , I didn't have any problems and my rings came just as shown in the picture and even better with a surprise little gift in the cutest tiny box which also makes great for a gift idea since it's already packaged up too cute !   Thanks again !!
"
"Shipment was very fast and the rings are adorable. Not to mention I received two extra rings and an adorable wooden box to store them in. Love love love!!!
"
"Great quality product with fast shipping.  Love the thick knuckle ring the best, it is very heavy, fits perfect and sure not to go anywhere during wear.  The other midi rings are sizeable so they do tend to move a bit on your finger during wear but they are all wonderful and great quality rings.  Highly recommend!
"
"I have several of Galyna's rings. They are all so beautiful and beautifully made.  I also now have a really pretty pair of her earrings.  I can't say enough how happy I am with my purchases.
"
"The ring is stunning and the care taken to package it came straight from the heart. Thank you!!
"
"These are spectacular I love love love them high quality and colors are vibrant and I‚Äôm always surprised with her quality and colors are so beautiful‚Äîalso they are not too heavy for my ears and I‚Äôm older and my ears pull down and these work!  Durability appears to be there as well‚ÄîI just received all of her earrings so hoping they will last and I‚Äôm very careful with these kinds of earrings‚Äîso very happy with purchase always and ordered three more because these are my outfits working on zoom all the time!
"
"Super adorable!! I bought them for my wedding and they were absolutely perfect for our butterfly bluff ceremony. I've gotten so many compliments on them, I can't wait to wear them more.
"
"Beautiful ring! Amazing customer service, and the ring looks great and is easily adjustable to fit each finger.
"
"Absolutely lovely ~ beautiful design and craftsmanship! So excited to incorporate this into my outfits
"
"Ab so lutely love it!!!
"
"It's so beautiful! And amazing quality! Thank you!
"
"Very beautiful ring, well made and came in a lovely box. It‚Äôs almost like it was made for my engagement ring! The seller contacted me through out the process and was very helpful!
"
"Stunning ring, fast delivery and excellent customer service. Many thanks - highly recommend!
"
"The ring dainty but very sparkly. Excellent communication all the way through. Very competitive pricing AND the workmanship and materials used are outstanding.
"
"Delighted with this beautiful engagement ring. It‚Äôs sweet, sparkly, and the fit is perfect. Thank you!
"
"Absolutely perfect! Bought these for our teen girls birthday gifts. Dainty and special. The packaging is terrific, making it a wonderful, special surprise! Thank you!
"
"It‚Äôs so cute!
"
"Super cute. Fit my pinky finger perfectly, great quality! Will purchase from this shop again!
"
"It was beautiful, the gold was a gorgeous color and so was the stone. It was minimalistic how I wanted and the letter (G) turned out great! 10/10 recommend!
"
"so good i'm getting 4 more!
"
"Love these unique finger rings - particularly the adjustable nature that allows me to wear them on any of my fingers.
"
"this was my 2nd purchase of these rings, i now have 6 and get so many compliments!
"
"A unique and modern interpretation of a nail guard ring. Simple but makes a big statement!
"
"It‚Äôs so much more amazing in person, I utterly love it. Naomie‚Äôs communication was extraordinary, she resized it for me and the little ring box was super cute. Thank you so much. I keep staring at it!
"
"Thank you Noemie for my stunning new ring! It is it is beautifully faceted & unique. Another great find from your special shop!
"
"Parfait et No√©mie est vraiment adorable et disponible merci üòä
"
"Blown away by this ring! I searched for one like it for awhile so was ecstatic to find it in No√©mie's shop. To top it off, she is extremely helpful, kind, and shipped super quickly. Will definitely be checking back in her shop and purchasing again!
"
"I bought myself this ring to honor my status as Cat Mom to 4 cats. I love it! It's so delicate and beautiful and it makes me happy to look at. :)
"
"The ring is darling and fits perfectly.  Well worth the wait.  A subtle detail that expresses my inner crazy cat lady.  Will recommend this purchase to others.
"
"Perfect dainty little cat ring. I wear it all the time!
"
"It took about a month to be delivered but it was worth the wait. The ring is petite and cute.
"
"I got 10, because I wear a ton of rings. So perfect. Exactly what I was wanting! The quality is excellent. They‚Äôre shiny and smooth and I wish I had more fingers so I could get more!
"
"Love love love!! I have multiple crystal rings and adding these made a perfect look! They‚Äôre true to sizing and very dainty. They‚Äôre on the pricier side in my opinion for such a small, plain ring, BUT the quality really did hold up so I would say it‚Äôs worth it. I‚Äôll be ordering them in the future cause I have already misplaced one!! Lol
"
"Shipped on time and arrived in a cute little gift box. Not adjustable so sizing for a midi ring is tough because it doesn‚Äôt ‚Äúflex‚Äù when your finger bends? Not sure if I‚Äôm the only one with this issue but other than that it‚Äôs perfect!!! Sterling silver- it‚Äôs not turning my finger green! Thank goodness! I love it!!
"
"I am very happy with my purchase and I look forward to placing another order! I purchased a set of 3 rings to wear as midi rings on my middle & ring fingers but decided on wearing them as stacking midi rings. Love. Love. Love.
"
"Gorgeous little dainty ring! Fast shipping, good communication with the shop owner ‚ù§Ô∏è the ring arrived packaged very beautifully, in a box, with a very sweet note. Thank you so much! The ring is very good quality. Been wearing it for about 4 days without taking it off and it still looks amazing. ‚ù§Ô∏è
"
 
 
"I wish I would have bought more. This bracelet is SO LUX I want all my girls to have one now. It‚Äôs the perfect size not too dainty not too thick the chain and clasp feel so well made. Came in a gift box with ribbon and lovely card with tissue. It‚Äôs my favorite Etsy purchase so far!!!! Thank you!!
"
"The ring is beautifully made. The size is slightly smaller than a normal sizes ring, just as the other reviews had mentioned, and which I was hoping it would be.
     The color was off, but the artist, Natalie, contacted me right away and kindly offered to make the ring over again, at no cost to me. I am very grateful for such great customer service. It was a pleasure communicating with Natalie. 
I will update this review when the ring arrives. And I'm confident that I'll be able to up my four star rating to five stars!
"
"All I can say about this ring is WOW. It fits perfectly and is even more beautiful in person. Thank you!!!!
"
"I love my ring!!! It is even more beautiful than I imagined!  Excellent craftsmanship, bright colors and the sizing is perfect!
"
"I absolutely love my nature ring!  It‚Äôs so beautiful!  Thank you also for the additional gift that was included!  I highly recommend this artist!!
"
"What a beautiful piece of jewellery! It arrived quickly and was packaged nicely. And it fits my index finger, middle finger and ring finger (on each hand) well without having to make any adjustments. I am 100% happy with this item. :)
"
"Very happy of my order ! It‚Äôs been a long time that I wanted a vampire ring like this ! I can‚Äôt wait to wear it for my next photo shoot.

The seller is really nice (very good communication) + Order received very quickly !
"
"Beautiful, fits on every finger apart from my thumb, looks gorgeous and a little deadly but that was the look I was expecting, the postage didn't take long at all. Will buy from here again :D
"
"Absolutely wonderful!  Fantastic product with amazing delivery time.  A+ communication from Seller and perfect amount of packaging!

I will most definitely be buying again!  Thank you ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
"
"I love my midi rings should have went a size up but they are so beautiful, I'm just going to order more,they are perfect, will be ordering again, thank you sooo much!
"
"So cute a little too small for my pointer and middle finger,  but that's ok just means I might buy more for those. The fit great on my pinky and ring fingers. Super fast shipping
"
"They are perfect! Love them! Will be buying more!
"
"My favorite jewelry pieces! will be ordering more in the future!
"
"Fits perfectly & I love the style. Fast shipping.
"
"I love this ring! It‚Äôs so cute, it‚Äôs thick and feels like a great quality of silver was used. I can‚Äôt wait to wear this all the time!
"
"Better than what i was expecting!!! doesn‚Äôt leave green at all so cute and suchhhh high quality.. all my friends now have matching ones with me!
"
"The ring is so gorgeous! The tiny cubic zirconia looks like a real diamond and I love that the band is a little thicker so it looks substantial on my finger. It‚Äôs a great ring for when I don‚Äôt want to wear my diamond halo ring.
"
"I love this ring. It's absolutely beautiful. You can feel the quality in its weight and feel. Thank you!
"
"Nice Quality ring, I get compliments on it daily. I will definitely be looking into some of their other items.
"
"Received! It‚Äôs perfect; looks and fits exactly as suggested in picture as well as size. It took a reasonable amount of time to be produced and shipping wasn‚Äôt too long which is good considering the logistics from Russia to the US. Very satisfied. ü§ôüèæ Thanks
"
"Truly lovely. I get compliments all the time. Really neat craftsmanship. Feels like I picked it up in Skyrim.
"
"This purchase replaces a previous purchase I lost. Fits perfect - with many compliments! I forget i have it on it for so well.
"
"beautiful. Definitely worth the wait! Will become a daily staple.
"
"Beautiful ring! It was a gift for my daughter, and she loves it. Worth the wait.

"Jason was very helpful and I appreciate how fast he got back to me. I received the jewelry yesterday and I am very happy with them.
"
"Absolutely Beautiful!! The Gem Stones are such a gorgeous color. Prompt shipping, nicely packaged. So very happy with my purchase. Thank you Jason!
"
"Absolutely love this bracelet. It is stunning, just like the picture! The seller was also amazing and worked with me to get it shipped by the date I needed! :)
"
"Beautiful and dainty, just as I hoped it would be! 

The initial bracelet I received was not exactly the product I ordered (just a colour mistake, small human error that is easy to make!) and Jason was very quick and helpful in correcting the issue!

The box it comes in is also great as it stops the very dainty chain from getting tangled.

Excellent experience all around.
"
"Love them so much !!
"
"the rings were too big for my hands so i shared them with a friend
"
"they are very beautiful however they aren't for long wear and did turn my finger green. I do understand I took a risk buying because I have such small fingers but only 2 fit as thumb rings I have size 4.7 fingers
"
"Thank you so much for these! I seem to be wearing a couple of these constantly with my rotation! They're really nice and haven't stained my fingers!
"
"Literally my favorite ring I‚Äôve ever had! It‚Äôs so comfortable, can fit on any finger, unique, high-quality, and absolutely beautiful! It‚Äôs got that sexy boho look and I feel radiant in it. I‚Äôve gotten countless compliments and only started wearing it a few days ago. It also came crazy fast. I was shocked. Will be buying more from this store!
"
"This ring is so comfortable and beautiful! I love that it can not only be adjusted for the fit around the finger but also for the spacing between the rings. This is going to be a new daily staple in my jewelry selection. Thank you!
"
"I love this ring. As soon as I found it I knew I wanted it. When saw it had such good reviews there was no question. I ordered it for my self for my birthday. It fits on my index and thumb (normally a size 7/12 to 8 or 8 1/2). I ordered a size 7 as that is my typical size for my ring finger but it was slightly big. I like wearing it on my index finger better anyways. I usually have a reaction to some metals and I am hoping that I won't have that problem over time. From the time I ordered it only took 5 days to get to me. Shipping was fast. I am thinking about ordering another one in the future.
"
"I love this ring. It is beautifully made, very well fitted, very well made, simple yet elegant. Such a small price to pay for a lovely ring. Placed my order, easy to do, got an estimated delivery date as to when I should receive my purchase and my package I believe came a day early. Easy steps, went like clock work for me. Again,  I absolutely love ‚ô•Ô∏è this ring. JC from USA
"
"Absolutely fabulous, I love it! Already looking what to buy next.
"
"I finally got my ring. It's beautiful and I love it. I ordered this to be shipped to the US, but due to covid-19 it took along time to arrive that's why I gave the shipping two stars.
"
"I've been looking for a pinky ring for some time now and then I found this knuckle ring and got it. Well it's perfect as a pinky ring, high quality as well! Shipping was incredibly fast, only a week to Finland. Highly recommend this shop!
"
"Really happy with that ring. I received it quickly also :) I recommend
"
"soooo happy with my piece, beautifully crafted and feels so at home on my finger :) thanks Kramike!
"
"I bought this time because I felt it was the perfect compliment to my tattoo, and not only was I correct, but the ring is beautiful and much more skillfully made than I was expecting! I can see a lot of finishing touches and careful work that went into designing this deceptively delicate looking ring. I couldn't be happier with my purchase! Thank you! I'll see you again soon, undoubtedly!
"
"I LOVE this ring! It is beautiful and it was carefully shipped. The sizing was exact. It was worth the wait.
"
"This ring is exactly what I was looking for. The seller was great with her communication. And it arrived super fast! In fact, it got here quicker than some domestic items I bought at the same time. I will definitely purchase from this shop again! A+++++

I've already placed a second order for another ring because of the quality and craftsmanship of their jewelry. You can't go wrong with KRAMIKE. One of my new favorite shops!

"I LOVE this ring. I‚Äôve been looking for a serpent ring that isn‚Äôt overpriced, that I can wear on my thumb as well as my finger. 
It looks so good and it‚Äôs my favourite piece of jewellery at the moment! Thank you üòä
"
"My sister loves this!! Looks exactly like the picture, also very adjustable.  I didn't get any tracking info whatsoever, and it took a while to get here, longer than it said it would. But I'm still very happy with it!
"
"Absolutely beautiful ring! The first package came quickly, but the ring box was empty, so I messaged customer service and they sent me a new one very quickly, my girlfriend loved it as a belated valentines present ‚ò∫Ô∏è
"
"Beautiful, unique and comfortable ring. So different and eye catching, I love it. The one comment I have is that it got caught in my jacket as I was putting it on, so just bear that in mind and don't be careless like me :D
"
"I bought this ring as a gift to myself, I love it and highly recommend it. It was made to order and shipped in a lovely package, it's clear that it's made with a lot of love. Thank you Marina! :)
"
"I love the rings i got SO MUCH. They are SO beautiful and the attention to detail is amazing. What you see is what you get.

The packaging was beautiful and the shipping was great (although long but i chose the cheaper shipping option!). The russian tracking number i was given gave accurate updates the entire way to my doorstep. The entire process of ordering from this shop was great and i cant wait to order again.

Marina sent me pictures of my rings before she shipped them out and has great customer service. she was so helpful about my shipping questions and she has such talent making these beautiful pieces. The rings are adjustable and fit comfortably after i sized them up (and I have some big fingers lol).
"
"Such a beautiful ring. Just like the pictures. Customer service was great and helpful with shipping. Tracking was great from russia to us. Everything came packaged in the cutest box and tie. I got the most beautiful heart charm with my purchase. 

The rings are adjustable and fit comfortably on my big size 9ish fingers lol. Marina sent me pictures before she mailed them and i loved that update. 

(The wait for shipping if you choose cheaper option to the US will take some time. Anticipate ordering well in advance if you need these as a gift -about 1.5 months to be safe. I gave one as a gift and they LOVE IT. Cant wait to order again.)

"The ring is absolutely perfect! It looks exactly as pictured. Marina took some extra time to ensure the ring would fit me since I have a larger ring size, and she kept me updated on the shipping changes. It was worth the wait because I love it and it fits great! It also arrived right in time for Mother's Day and it will look so springy with my dress. I will order from her shop again!
"

Thank you thank you!! üñ§üñ§üñ§üñ§‚ôèÔ∏è‚ôãÔ∏è Edit: they get caught on off clothes and jackets/ sweaters...I wish she could make it a more solid material. Other than that no complaints. I don‚Äôt want to ruin this beautifully made ring. Still worth owning this piece of art.ü§ç
"
"Bangle is absolutely beautiful and if you have a small wrist like me , the 2.25 is the way to go. Any bigger may be to big , however it will still look beautiful because it‚Äôs made with such great quality and looks great on the wrist. 

Plus this item is a gift for my sister and the package came with a nice gift bag which is so so nice !!!
"
"Very cute. It matches my Yin Yang stud ring. I was looking everywhere for a knuckle Yin Yang ring & glad I  I found one here. I love the cute things in this shop!
"
"I absolutely love this ring but it did take almost two months to get to me.
"
"Loved it! It is an adjustable ring, so you can wear it as midi ring or regular ring. I already ordered another ring for my friend. Great product and fast shipping!
"
"Oh an alien kick right now! Right was a little small but it is cute as an upper knuckle ring. Loving it for the price.
"
 
"Love my new rings! They are very detailed, light weighted, and fit my tiny hand very well =]. The wait for them was worth it.

"The ring fits perfectly and the tiny white flowers are beautiful! There ring I received had slightly more white than purple color compared to the etsy photo, but certainly doesn't detract from this stunning piece of jewelry! I'm very happy with my lovely new ring! It took a month to ship from Ukraine to USA.
"

The workmanship is incredible!  I am very happy with my purchase, the prompt reply from Nuran, the quick shipping.  Thanks Nuran!

"
"Item was great - the gift was loved. However, the seller said it would ‚Äòdefinitely‚Äô be delivered by Mother‚Äôs Day and it was delivered over a week later. The seller did apologise but it still left the person without a gift, and it wasn‚Äôt slightly late, it was over a week late
"
"Good gift, looked great and mum loved it,
"
 
"I‚Äôve been looking for a perfect thin little stacking ring and this is the best one! It‚Äôs super thin so I barely feel it. I wear it on my index finger and I love it! This shop is wonderful! Super pretty, super shiny
"
"I love this ring! Excellent quality. I've been wearing it for 3 months now and it hasn't left my finger green or bent at all and looks the same as the day I got it. I never take it off because it's so comfortable. It is the perfect understated, sleek ring. Thank you so much!
"

"Zu meinem Geburtstag wollte ich mir selbst eine Freude machen und habe mir eine neue Uhr bestellt. Sie wurde sehr schnell verschickt und kam sch√∂n verpackt in goldenem Papier bei mir an. Die Uhr ist wie auf den Produktfotos abgebildet. Sie ist sehr leicht und am Handgelenk kaum zu sp√ºren. Was mich bei der Bestellung schon positiv √ºberraschte war, dass man sogar ein Armband dazu bestellen konnte. Ich werde hier definitiv wieder bestellen. Das werden sch√∂ne Geschenke!
"
"Schnelle, einwandfreie Lieferung. Der Ring sieht klasse aus, kann ich nur weiterempfehlen!
"
"Die edle Armkette kam sehr sch√∂n verpackt fr√ºher bei uns an, als angegeben. Sehr schnelle Lieferung und perfekt verpackt. Praktisch, dass gleich eine sch√∂ne Geschenkverpackung dabei ist. Das Kettchen ist prima in der Gr√∂√üe zu verstellen und ein wahrer Blickfang am Handgelenk. Absolut empfehlenswert!
"
"toller Ring, entspricht der Beschreibung

"Just beautiful and perfect ring
"
"Very beautiful ring and a very kind and helpful contact! Thank you ‚ù§Ô∏è
"
"J‚Äôattends toujours ma commande depuis le 26/11!
"
"Love them! Wore them the entire day after I got them and they haven't bent/changed shape at all or turned my fingers green (which were my primary concerns).  They are easy enough to change to the exact size you need, but not too easy to where they will move around once you get them to the perfect adjustment.  Shipped right on schedule.  Will shop again!
"
"I adore these rings! I love the fact that they are adjustable because I can wear them on any finger! Plus they are super cute!
"
"Such cute little gold knuckle rings! They were shipped very quickly and seem to be very good quality. Love that they're adjustable. Very pleased with the purchase!
"
"They are absoloutely what they say - sturdy & dainty all at once! I love them and they are adjustable which is perfect for me because I always want to wear rings on different fingers
"
"Bijou magnifique et transaction impeccable !
Merci beaucoup pour tout !
"
"Perfect size. Fits perfectly. Solid silver. Real silver. Easy communication with shop owner for questions. Bracelet matches the picture on Etsy. Very satisfied!  Thanks Nicolas for a great experience and product!
"
"The seller was helpful and polite, shipping was fast.

The product was wrapped in a nice bag and I received free incense.

The quality of the product seems to me excellent.
I made a little effort to put it, and a larger size externally, I suggest you use oil and cold water after cleaning the product
"
"Super!!
La gravure est exactement ce que j'attendais.
Mr Nicolas est tr√®s passionn√© et attentionn√© √† tous les d√©tails
Il est tr√®s poli et convivial.
Merci pour votre professionnalisme.

"They shipped fast and I was thrilled to get them. The rings are lovely. I've already ordered another set! Definitely a seller I will be recommending to others and will shop with more in the future.
"
"Beautiful set! Rings are delicate with gorgeous finishes. Seller was incredibly helpful. I would buy again!
"
"Beautifully crafted and matches my set of most frequently worn rings. The 4.25 size i ordered fit very well on the lower knuckles of my left index finger. Shop owner was also a great, supportive communicator during what we thought was a shipping mishap! Many thanks, 5 stars.
"
 
"I absolutely love my ring and necklace purchase. I'm wearing my ring everyday and the necklace almost just as much. They are both such unique pieces with their concrete elements. Debating getting two more rings so I can stack. They only thing holding me back is the fact that my fingers are short and stubby. :) Also impressed with the speed in which I received the pieces. They shipped from Israel to NYC in under 2 weeks.

"This is a truly unique and sophisticated design, elegant yet interesting. It is low profile, smooth and comfortable. It was hard to choose a thread colour but black goes with everything so that‚Äôs what I picked! I love this piece and will wear it frequently. My only regret is not ordering a stacking companion! I am so grateful for talented artisans like Hadas whose ingenuity allows women like me to feel a little more special.
"
"Es passen alle Fingerspitzen dank individueller Einstellung. Was ich wirklich klasse finde es sind zwei als Ersatz mit dabei. Ich freue mich bereits auf mein Event denn die Spitzen sind kleines Detail was das Gro√üe und Ganze noch abrundet.
"
"Very happy with these lovely nails !
"
"They're very adjustable just by pinching them into place. They sellers goes out of her way to make the item feel personalized and I appreciate it that.
"
"i love them! They are beautiful and fit well.
"
"I don't have it on at the moment. But I can just say out of all the rings I have purchased similar to this on Etsy. Honestly it was so well worth the wait. It was desidnged beautifully can expand. 
Just want to thank you for the beautiful ring and I will definitely be shopping with you guys in the future.

"Ravie ! La bague est vraiment jolie :) Envoi rapide et joliment emball√© ‚ô•
"
"Une vendeuse top, r√©active et √† l'√©coute pour poser des questions sur les produits!
En ce qui concerne la bague elle est tr√®s bien. Je la voyais toutefois un peu plus fine mais c'est une erreur d'appr√©ciation de ma part.
"
"C'est vraiment magnifique, bravo √† vous ! On voit bien que c'est fabriqu√© avec amour ;)

"
"Item is unique and crafty. It is adjustable and does not leave any green on my finger thanks to the steps seller takes in finalizing product. I love that it looks handmade. Great product!
"
"We opted for two eye earrings and my teenager absolutely loves them. We both have very sensitive ears so finding beautiful and unique earrings is a challenge, but these are a win!
"
"I‚Äôm so in love üòª it‚Äôs beautiful ü§©, can‚Äôt wait to wear them AND an ankle came with my waist beads üíó so now I have a cute matching set.
"
"They‚Äôre beautiful, they boost my self esteem and make me feel confident in my body. I look forward to purchasing from this shop again‚ù§Ô∏è
"
"I love them so much. They are very danty.
"
"Pretty and practical! The beads are very delicate and uniform. Good length (long enough to drape nicely but not so long that glasses hang too low) and the loops are adjustable so I was able to fit them over my thick frames without a problem.
"
"Love it! Worth every penny. Very dainty and exactly what I was looking for. Pictures don‚Äôt do it any justice. If you‚Äôre thinking of buying it - add it to your cart! Seller answered questions promptly. Very polite and helpful! Thank you Michael!!

"I am Seventh-day Adventist and many SDAs do not typically wear jewelry. I only choose to wear a simple wedding band. My previous ring no longer fits right. 

I was looking for a simple rose gold ring in a reasonable price range. I like that the gold-filled option is an affordable alternative. 

Joe did not disappoint. The packaging was meticulous, personalized, and just elegantly cute! Such a lovely touch. 

The band was thinner than I imagined but I actually love it. Looks delicate, yet is solid. I love that I can‚Äôt feel it while I‚Äôm wearing it. So light. It‚Äôs the perfect minimalist ring. Thank you, Joe!
"
"Just like the picture. Love it. So simple. I got a size 7 & I‚Äôm wearing it on my thumb.
"
"Is absolutely perfect! Fits beautifully between my Claddaugh engagement ring & wedding band- both in Yellow Gold. A little sliver of Rose Gold. Exactly what I was looking for! Thanks very much!
"
"I received my ring today. Just what I was looking for. Perfect rose gold Danity ring. I wear on my wedding finger. Shipping time was fast.

"
"I could not love this ring more! Getting ready to order another one! So beautiful!
"
"It's so delicate looking and pretty!  I got it so I could wear my baby boy's initial and birthstone when I am at work and not around him.  I love it! Such a great price for such a lovely ring :)

"Sono rimasta soddisfatta dell'acquisto dell'anello d'argento con pepita, molto carino! Inoltre a una mia richiesta di personalizzazione per la misura regolabile ho trovato disponibilit√† e gentilezza, non mi sento di dare la quinta stellina per l'attesa un po' troppo lunga ma devo dire che a parte questo mi sono trovata benissimo!
"
"Orecch√¨ni molto belli! Ho voluto entrambi gli orecchini con il cuoricino rosso e Lorenza mi ha accontentata! Un po‚Äô di ritardo nella spedizione ma in compenso ho ricevuto un tenero omaggio! Grazie!
"
"La combinazione di questi tre anelli per me √® bellissima...inoltre sono comodi e leggeri e con l‚Äôeffetto martellato che ho chiesto...grazie a nubyvago per la sua disponibilit√† e bravura!
"
"Ho scelto ed acquistato questa collana tra molte per poter supportare piccole realt√† di artigianato italiane. Una volta arrivata sono rimasta stupita dalla precisione e dalla sua bellezza, nonostante sia un ciondolo ""semplice"" fa il suo effetto. Ha decisamente superato le mie aspettative! 
Acquister√≤ sicuramente altri articoli, ma sceglierne uno sar√† difficile, perch√® sono uno pi√π bello dell'altro.

Grazie.
"
"Wasn't sure about the size, but a 9 fits my ring finger perfectly! I bought this to replace another eye ring I had and I love it! The seller even included a little joke in the packaging which I really appreciate! Thank you!!
"
"oh. my. gawd. It's here! I never *ever* buy rings online, so I was quite nervous, but darling Stephanie came through with flying colors! The ring is the perfect size and is almost flush to my skin,  so I'm certain it won't catch. This ring is beautiful as a solo ring or in an ensemble (don't worry- I checked;)). What a beautiful piece- I will certainly be shopping with her again!
"
"I ordered 3 of these little guys, and i love them to bits. Think they are adorable. I just wish they fit better. My fingers are pretty thin but my knuckles are big, so I struggle with rings. But I will make it work! Shipping was record speed too!
"
"I'm obsessed! I bought a size four for a midi ring and it is even better in person. Its so cute and dainty, but it feels very sturdy for a 3D print. I can't wait to make another purchase here.
"
"I love my rings! Chandy's customer service and attention to detail are top notch. I highly recommend this shop. I am very happy!
"
"It's perfect and it shipped quick!! üòç

"Just received my 3rd toe ring from here. I list one of them. I asked that it be made a little bigger than a 2 1/2 and it‚Äôs perfect! On my toe and I will always wear it!
"
"Obsessed with my new toe ring! Wonderful quality, fast shipping! Highly recommend.
"
"I love it!

"
"I like it but they get in the way and where they are attached they are bulky and get stuck on things. But super cute and fit for all fingers
"
"I can‚Äôt stop staring at my new engagement ring! Honestly it‚Äôs one of the prettiest rings I‚Äôve ever seen. My fianc√© is very proud of it and I‚Äôm a very happy fianc√©e. He says his favorite part is how much I love it. Lena was amazing and patient answering all our questions about fitting it with wedding bands we had from my grandma. She even gave us a little sneak video to help with our excitement (though to be honest it was all my excitement)!  Shipping was incredibly fast! I hear nothing but compliments when people notice my ring!
"
"From the fianc√©:
 
I found Lena on Etsy several years ago while browsing for jewelry, and instantly fell in love with her beautiful rings. Even before dating my now-fianc√©, I dreamily ‚Äúfavorited‚Äù this emerald engagement ring, thinking that someday I‚Äôd be engaged to the love of my life with this ring on my finger. I can‚Äôt believe that day has finally come! It is even more beautiful in-person and I couldn‚Äôt be happier with Lena‚Äôs craftsmanship! Most importantly, the ring has special significance to me knowing that it was handmade in Israel where I was born, spent the first five years of my life, and still visit to see family. Thank you, Lena, for being a part of this memorable time in our lives!
"
"Love love love love love. The top photo shows the contrast in direct sunlight, and the bottom is inside. Depending on the lighting the grey will be more pronounced. (The colors seen in the bottom photo are from a stained glass window reflecting nearby!) I absolutely love this ring and am so glad we chose to order from Lena. She answered any and every question I had and the ring took only 3 days to arrive once shipped. After spending weeks looking for a salt and pepper diamond, I was thrilled to come across this listing. If you are even considering a salt and pepper diamond, do not hesitate to inquire about this beauty!
"
"Words can‚Äôt even describe how impressed I was! At first I was skeptical ordering a ring without seeing it in person. However I‚Äôm so glad I did! Lena was amazing throughout the whole process! My boyfriend and I picked out this ring together as my engagement ring, but has not yet proposed, so waiting to officially wear it! Highly recommend this shop! They were very flexible with payments and doing custom sizing. Couldn‚Äôt have had a better experience!
"
"I have several of Galyna's rings. They are all so beautiful and beautifully made.  I also now have a really pretty pair of her earrings.  I can't say enough how happy I am with my purchases.
"
"Super adorable!! I bought them for my wedding and they were absolutely perfect for our butterfly bluff ceremony. I've gotten so many compliments on them, I can't wait to wear them more.
"
"These are spectacular I love love love them high quality and colors are vibrant and I‚Äôm always surprised with her quality and colors are so beautiful‚Äîalso they are not too heavy for my ears and I‚Äôm older and my ears pull down and these work!  Durability appears to be there as well‚ÄîI just received all of her earrings so hoping they will last and I‚Äôm very careful with these kinds of earrings‚Äîso very happy with purchase always and ordered three more because these are my outfits working on zoom all the time!
"
"OMG OMG OMG they are beautiful more beautiful than i imagined and they hang beautifully as well‚ÄîI‚Äôm going to order more of her products they rock and thank you MAHALO so happy i ordered them
"
"Love! These are exactly what I wanted--delicate, well-crafted, and at a great price! In the picture I'm wearing a 2.5 in my pinky, a 3.5 on my upper index, and a 7 on my lower index.
"
"They are really pretty! I would love if this was sold in solid gold. I've worn it since the day I've received it (about 5 days ago). I found it chips little bit easy so I wouldn't recommend 24-7 wear, butttttt holy mother of pearls, I can't stop staring at how pretty my fingers look!! :) :) Thank you for the speedy responses as well! Definitely have a repeat customer in me.
"
"Wow one of my all time favorite purchases from Etsy!  I was worried these wouldn‚Äôt arrive before my vacation in two days (because I ordered them later than I had originally planned), but they came today!  So happy I‚Äôll be able to bring them with me.  The rings I ordered are absolutely everything I hoped for.  Beautiful and dantiy.  The seller provided wonderful packaging, with instructions on care and a jewelry cloth for cleaning.  The personal note and coupon code were perfect bonuses! I will be ordering more from this shop in the near future.  So excited over this purchase and gift for myself.  Thank you!

"OMG!  I received my first order for this ring and was completely blown away by the detail, polish and finish; it is so amazingly crafted, that I actually ordered another one a few days later as a gift.  I cannot stop staring at it and being a lover of 'silver' jewellery, it was well worth the money.  Anyone hesitating to buy, trust me, you will not regret this purchase - you get a lovely bracelet added in. I cannot recommend enough plus super fast delivery and I cannot stop smiling every time I look at my hand :))  Thank you!!

Shipping was fast and the unexpected little present added a nice touch. I highly recommend the product and the seller.‚ù§Ô∏è
"

"
"Better than what i was expecting!!! doesn‚Äôt leave green at all so cute and suchhhh high quality.. all my friends now have matching ones with me!

"Customer service for this shop is superb. This item that was sent to my apartment was lost in the mail, and the seller offered to resend it to my parents‚Äô house. I really appreciate this kindness! Plus, this ring is adorable‚ÄîI‚Äôm gifting it to my sister for her move to NYC üèô Thank you! ‚ò∫Ô∏è
"
"My items got list in transit and she was nice enough to resend it for free! Really great customer service and would a hundred percent recommend and order again üòäüòä
"
"I am in love with these rings. They were shipped quickly and came in carefully put together, elegant packaging. The rings are beautifully made and I love wearing them. I'll definitely be back for more. Highly recommended!
"
"The ring was shipped almost immediately after I ordered it and arrived in short order. Thank you so much!

I was worried that it would prove to be a little too small for my index finger, since my usual ring size is EU 62/ US 10 but the part that is adjustable is very intricate so it even looks good on somewhat chubby fingers! The pcitures really don't do it justice - can wholeheartedly recommend this piece!
"
"Shipped really quickly. Exactly what I wanted. Nice and sharp. Photos don't do the quality justice. Came with pretty packaging too. Love it.
"
"The claw rings are amazing! Thank you so much! I also couldn't believe how fast the shipping was!  üñ§
"
"This is amazing! Looks completely real.
I really needed to get some quicker shipping organised, so Marina went out of her way to sort it out for me. As a result the package arrived in about 12 working days, just on time for me! 
The ring is so well crafted, incredible detail and care. 
Thank you Marina! You rock!
"
"This ring is GORGEOUS, it‚Äôs on an adjustable ring so I can wear it on any finger and the size and color is breathtaking!
"
"Holy heck, what a gorgeous ring! It is incredibly well crafted and looks uncannily real. I absolutely love it.
"
"Such a beautiful ring! Very delicate, and believe it or not - it looks so much better in real life!!! It arrived in perfect condition.
"
"beautiful ring and fits on exactly the finger that I want it to. I love all her pieces and they are all so unique. A++ seller
"
"thank you for a great looking ring!  fits perfect too..
"
"Just as pictured and a perfect fit! Love it! Thank you !!
"
"Always, always love the items from this shop.  Many friends have asked for my rings! Great seller!
"
"I adore my new rose gold druzy ring. It‚Äôs the perfect size and well made. 
It also goes well with all of the new rose gold pieces I‚Äôve gotten recently.
"
"El anillo es m√°s bonito que en las fotos.
El paquete lleg√≥ puntualmente.
Satisfecha con la compra en esta tienda. Probablemente repetir√©.
"
"loved the ring thank you so much!!!!!
"
"Very pretty necklace!! So forest fairy style. The only thing I wish is that for the price we pay, she could hv put real labradorite beads instead of glass/plastic beads  and a bit larger pendent and she still would hv made tons of profit. Then the necklace would hv looked even prettier. But no worries, I changed it with bigger stone and labradorite beads like I wanted. Seller is very friendly and shipping was very prompt as well. thank You and goodluck!!
"
"Amazing seller! Very kind. Package came in 3 weeks which is pretty good for an international package. All rings fit and are gorgeous! Ordered 15 but received 14 (I‚Äôm okay with that)
"
"I love these rings they are so cute! I have very small hands and they all fit which is amazing, nice variety of patterns and sizes as well over all very lovely set would recommend buying! Also fast delivery and very good customer care from V2Sbeautiful
"
"seller was very helpful after my package got lost, and sent me a full new set. i highly appreciate it ! the rings were worth the wait. they look really cute !
"
"Perfect! Love the variety of sizes!üíï
"
 
 
"This ring is perfect. The letters are 1/4"" high and the X and O combined are almost 1/2"" wide. It is a bright shiny gold. Does not seem Dainty and small. If you are thinking of getting it for your favorite Chi-O, DO IT!! Shipped super fast from California. I love it!!
"
"Shipping and delivery was SO fast!! & the quality of this ring is amazing. It‚Äôs so lightweight, you can barely tell it‚Äôs on your finger, and it doesn‚Äôt look like it‚Äôs going to tarnish either. Definitely recommend this seller!
"
"OMG! I am lost of words! They are so pretty! Can‚Äôt wait to wear them! Wish I was able to put one on my thumbs but it‚Äôs no big deal!
"
"it came soooo fast and it‚Äôs very cute! the sizes vary ( im normally a size 7 ) and some fit my pinkies and other fit my thumbs. love love love üòÅ
"
"Gorgeous rings. I love all the designs. One thing I will say is maybe stay away from these if you are a ring size 8 (like me) or up. Only 2 of the rings fit my fingers fully. Other than that if I had small fingers I would wear this set everyday.
"
"These are really pretty! They were on the big side and I can usually fit size US size 6/7 and most were big on me. But other than that the rings are so cute!
"
"I love this ring so much! True to size have worn it loads and no discolouration. Would definitely recommend
"
"Love these earrings! Super cute and well made.
"
 
"Finde den Preis f√ºr die Ohrringe etwas √ºberteuert. Sie sind schief und auf dem Bild sehen sie hochwertiger aus. Bin bisschen entt√§uscht aber ich behalte sie trotzdem. Sind Okay.
"
"Rings are perfect and exactly how they look on photos. Super happy with my purchase!
"
"very pretty and looks perfect with my other rings.
"
"Absolutely beautiful. I love it and thanks for the cute earrings as a gift üéÅ
"
"Love it! Was delivered quite fast and will definitely be purchasing more items! :)
"
"Love my ring. I wear it as a midi ring and it looks so cute! Shipping was rather quick. Very satisfied!
"
"This ring is so much nicer than I ever expected!  Especially for the price. The craftsmanship is superb, the size is perfect, and it just a thoroughly beautiful piece. I couldn‚Äôt be happier!
"
"Shipping was very fast (1 or 2 days) and took ~3 weeks for delivery to the United States. I'm very happy with how much the stones sparkle and the price. Thank you!
"
"I'm very very pleased with my order. My ring arrived very quickly and its more beautiful up close! Can't wait to buy more. Its so dainty, i love it!! Highly recommended!!
"
"Beautiful ring! Super fast shipping!
"
"So originally I was obsessed with the Tiffany&Co Paloma Picasso olive leaf ring. However, after going to Tiffany‚Äôs and trying it on... it didn‚Äôt quite spark joy.. plus it was 250 for sterling silver. I figured there‚Äôd be something similar on Etsy when I came across this ring. Let me just tell you, the photo does no justice. This ring is so beautiful and definitely sparks joy!! The only negative thing is that since I work with my hands a lot, it gets snagged onto things and it has cut up my finger. Even so, it is probably one of my favorite rings!!
"
"I love my ring so much I can‚Äôt believe how good they came out hopefully I‚Äôll be able to work with you in the future thank you so much you do beautiful work!
"
"This bracelet is beautiful, so shiny, and high quality! Shipping was also very fast. Don‚Äôt forget to size up, since it‚Äôs a chunkier bracelet. I have a 6 inch wrist and the 6.5 inch bracelet was too small, unfortunately. I‚Äôm hoping a local jeweler will be able to resize it for me!
"
"Just as I imagined.  So lovely
"
"Thank you for the wonderful customer service. An extra thank you for not having any delivery issues. During COVID although trying to understand it‚Äôs been difficult for all businesses in general ...I have paid for items and never received them and have had a problem even reaching customer service for a refund for paying for something I never even received. It sucks. So thank you again for being so great. Love my ring it‚Äôs beautiful. God bless.
"
"Love this ring! Thank you!
"
"Love the ring great work
"
"Perfect & just what I needed, thank you Tzufa!
"
"Very helpful and loved my item!
"
"Fast shipping & accurate description of product!
"
"Freaking obsessed!
"
"I am Seventh-day Adventist and many SDAs do not typically wear jewelry. I only choose to wear a simple wedding band. My previous ring no longer fits right. 

I was looking for a simple rose gold ring in a reasonable price range. I like that the gold-filled option is an affordable alternative. 

Joe did not disappoint. The packaging was meticulous, personalized, and just elegantly cute! Such a lovely touch. 

The band was thinner than I imagined but I actually love it. Looks delicate, yet is solid. I love that I can‚Äôt feel it while I‚Äôm wearing it. So light. It‚Äôs the perfect minimalist ring. Thank you, Joe!
"
"Just like the picture. Love it. So simple. I got a size 7 & I‚Äôm wearing it on my thumb.
"
"Is absolutely perfect! Fits beautifully between my Claddaugh engagement ring & wedding band- both in Yellow Gold. A little sliver of Rose Gold. Exactly what I was looking for! Thanks very much!
"
"I received my ring today. Just what I was looking for. Perfect rose gold Danity ring. I wear on my wedding finger. Shipping time was fast.
"
"Wonderful shop
Great quality!!
"
 
"this clutch purse was adorable. bought it for vegas for my bachelorette. however i gave it three stars because the chain strap kept breaking!! multiple multiple times all weekend.. on both sides. ended up using safety pins to hold it together by the end of the trip! that being said I did like the purse but just be warned to be prepared to have to fix it while out!
"
"Excellent customer service. She helped me figure out how to size my iWatch. The watch bracelet is beautiful. I just received a complement on it today by someone who wants to buy one herself. I bought my band two weeks ago and it feels really sturdy, and I‚Äôm rough on all my stuff. I highly recommend this seller. 5 stars!
"
"My sister loved this! What an amazing keychain and gift. I wish I knew about them earlier, as it would have came clutch when I was clueless on what I should get for someone's birthday. 

In terms of the quality, so far so good! The keychain has not broken down or anything. The letters are still in place, and the colour of the clay is still like new. 
What I love about the size of the keychain, is that it's not too big (can fit in a pocket) and that it's not too small (doesn't get lost/easier to find). 

I would recommend Akjewelll to anyone who wants to get a sense of beautifully handmade crafts. I will gladly purchase from here again!
"
"I am so so obsessed with these earrings! The size is perfect and the blushy pale pink is so pretty!! (Although the look brown in the photo I took of themü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è) highly recommend!! X
"
"These earrings are so freaking cute!! The colour is gorgeous the size is perfect and they shipped fast! Thanks again! X
"
"Loooooove the design of these!! Bought them for a reasonable price and they match this skirt I had in such a fun way!!
"
"Very beautiful and delicate! Wonderful presentation!
"
 
"Just.. wow üëè This ring is perfection! ‚ù§ I must say, as an avid ring wearer, this one has me impressed. I adore that it is dainty but also a statement piece. The hammered look has become my favorite style, and I'm grateful I stumbled across this design. I'm soo happy with my experience with this seller üôå
"
"I love delicate tiny rings and this is a beauty. The 4mm blue topaz is sparkling and just splendid. This company is amazing. Mollie helped me make decisions and then beautifully crafted this perfect ring. The ring pictured above is not the ring I finally ordered. I selected 14k gold instead of silver.  Thank you MuYin.
"
"This tiny sunflower ring is so sweet! I got it to use as a toe ring, but it also fits both of my pinkie fingers and I can wear it as a midi-ring on other fingers as well. It is *very* petite, a little moreso than I was expecting, even after closely reading the description. But it is super cute and I don‚Äôt even notice it when I wear it on my toe, it‚Äôs so comfy.
"
"I got the matching sunflower earring and band ring and they are adorable!! Thank you.
"
"Very petite! Just the way I like!
"
"Very petite! Just the way I like!
"
"I love this ring. I bought it in silver, it‚Äôs a perfect pinky ring.
"
"Took me a while to get used to wearing an adjustable ring but I love it! I get a lot of compliments on it! BUT if you plan on purchasing the rose gold style, note that it's not for everyday wear - my rose gold plating only lasted a few weeks after daily wear (I was looking for a new signature ring)
"
"Absolutely love my new ring and it came in sooner than expected! Would definitely shop from here again.. thank you Zoey!!
"
"Gorgeous ring and it shipped so fast! A++ seller!
"
"Dainty but very sturdy. I have child-size hands, so this ring suits me well; very subtle and elegant. Unlike other sterling silver open ring I have, this ring is not easily bent. (I lost an open ring before, because it's too soft and twisted, pulled away from my finger without me knowing.)
"
"Thinner than I thought based off the pictures, but I haven't taken it off yet
"
"Love it and now I have a new ring that actually fits! Very delicate and pretty.
"
"It is delicate and beautiful. Very Comfortable.
"
"Anello molto carino √® colorato, mi piace tantissimo il materiale, √® leggero e quasi non ci si accorge di indossarlo. Inoltre adoro la possibilit√† di combinare insieme due o pi√π anelli scegliendo gli abbinamenti di colore. Semplice ma di effetto. Spedizione e pacchetto come da tempi indicati, arrivo senza problemi.
"
"it finally came but they were broken when they arrived
"
 
 
"This is a pretty ring, but it will snag on everything towels sweaters, I wish I could return this ring. I bought 1 for my daughter also and she won‚Äôt wear it because it has snagged on her clothes.
"
 
"Not worth the money. Too small and made cheap. Would not recomend it to anyone.
"
"Absolutely awesome! Quick and safe shipping even during the 2020 holiday and I couldn't be happier. The note and packaging is so cute and the ring is so perfect, I just hope my girlfriend likes it as much as I do :)
"
"Fast shipping, perfect size, overall really really great! I've been wearing this midi ring since I got it and despite pervious concern, it has never fallen off once. Its definitely one of my favorite rings Ive ever purchased. Thank youu!!
"
"I love it!  Reminds me of the place I wish I was.  :) thank you!! üê¨üê†üåä
"
"Absolutely love this ring! Came quickly and fits perfectly. Looks  beautiful in person
"
"Absolutely in love with this ring! I get compliments all the time on it. Fast shipping as well. Thank you.
"
"The customer service I recieved was Outstanding...from me ordering, to Carole ensuring the ring was perfect for my needs. Highly recommended. Loved the presentation of the ring when I recieved it....x
"
"Absolutely gorgeous earrings. Great communication with seller and prompt delivery - thank you so much!
"
 
 
"Absolutely lovely earrings with really good quality as well! Really in love with the product!!<3 The dispatch was very fast and smooth too!
"
"The design is so chic and fashion and it's good money for this high level of quality in accessories. Suitable for dating and special occasion 100ÔºÖ. Love the purchase.
"
"Love the earrings so so much! The delivery was very fast as well, I totally enjoyed the purchase experience!
"
"So unique and beautiful! Love it
"
"Very cute, about the size of a real daisy, surprised. Good fast delivery and pleasant seller.

"Magnifique bague ! il s'agit de mon troisi√®me achat dans cette boutique !
Ari est un artisan talentueux et toujours tr√®s r√©actif ! J'appr√©cie l'originalit√© de ses cr√©ations!
Excellente communication et livraison rapide !
Je reviendrai surement !
"
"If there were more stars I would add them. Ari worked with me in customizing the ring and also a matching pair of earrings with garnet and moonstones. He was responsive, easy to communicate and so flexible. I received my jewelry today and just love them. The sizing of the ring was perfect and they both look stunning. They are artful, classy and bold with a vintage elegance. Thank you Ari! Coming back for more :)
"
"The overall appearance of the ring is more gray than it appeared online, but the quality is outstanding and communication with the seller was great. I'm happy with my new right-hand ring and it goes beautifully with my rose gold and gray diamond engagement ring and wedding band.
"
"My daughter has this ring in rose gold and I had admired it. I ordered it in gold. We both get so many compliments on it. Arik is excellent in his communication with the buyer and ships promptly (3 days with DHL). I couldn't believe how quickly I received my ring and how beautifully wrapped it was. What attention to detail.
Thank you Arik!
"
"I love this shop! Will most definitely be buying most of my jewelry from here! I got my order incredibly quick and safely. The packaging is 10 out 10. I love it!
"
"The rings are very cute and simple and I love that I can have multiple. I was a little disappointed by how many pinkie-sized rings I received which lessened the diversity but I still have other sizes for my other fingers so that‚Äôs ok. The material leaves a light green color on my finger after just one time washing my hands so I guess I will have to take them off each time. Overall a stylish set of rings that go with any look but I expected the material to be a bit better quality.
"
"I absolutely love these rings and they shipped so fast
"
"The quality of these rings are great and they look exactly like the picture. I was looking for stackable rings and these are great!
"
 
"I received this Turquoise ring yesterday and it is really good looking,just like the Lapis Lazuli ring I purchased before.Thank you,Maya Studio for two pretty rings.
"
"I asked for ruby because all three of my boys are July and I‚Äôve had trouble finding a mothers ring with three very different rings.  This is perfect and arrived the day before Mother‚Äôs Day.  Each ring represents the personality of each kid.  I am so grateful and happy. Thank you so much.
"
"The silver work is beautiful (smooth, no firescale!), the cabochon is balanced, perfectly clear and feels extremely secure in the bezel. Thank you for this mesmerizing dewdrop; I‚Äôll wear this often.
"
"Very cute and fit perfect. Exactly as described.
"
"I love my ring its just wot i wonted
"
"This ring is absolutely perfect and was exactly what my husband and I were hoping for. Naama reached out immediately after I ordered the ring to make sure she got all the details right about the ring including the color and finish. It is absolutely gorgeous and fits my husband perfectly. We will definitely be buying from this wonderful shop again! Thank you, Naama!
"
"I really love this ring, I just have a hard time adjusting size to finger. Thats not a bad thing, it‚Äôs because the metal is such good quality that it doesn‚Äôt bend to easily. It really is beautifully designed
"
"beautiful and dainty ring! I love that it can fit any of my fingers!
"
"Ya lo llevo puesto!!  Est√† precioso y no molesta con ning√∫n zapato. Gracias
"
"Beautiful.  Love how dainty and perfect it is.
"
"A beautiful and delicate ring, very pretty and very well made. I love it! Lovely seller, great communication. Recommended 10/10! Very beautiful jewellery. Thank you.
"
"I loved everything about this cute ring , the fit is amazing , great quality and most of all the beat customer service I have ever received !! I will be ordering a real gold wedding band soon ! Can‚Äôt wait ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏èMerci Beaucoup !
"
"(My second time buying from this shop), the ring is just as pictured. I am able to wear this ring every day, and so far (after 2 months) it still looks so pretty! 
Julie is always awesome to message about any of her products, packaging/special requests. Its always a pleasure talking to her and also being able to receive her jewels in the mail
"
"I received the rings in the mail and absolutely loved it!  it‚Äôs so delicate and lightweight. Minimalist is an art!
I appreciate Julie‚Äôs quick response and her going above and beyond to help me find the perfect fit.

Awesome customer service. I would 100% order again!
"
"Tr√®s beaux produits de qualit√©!  Bon prix et propri√©taire g√©n√©reuse ! :) 
Merci beaucoup!!!
"
"I wear this everyday and it‚Äôs held up perfectly! Really good quality material and it shipped to me very quickly!
"
"this ring is perfect fit, it goes great with my other rings
"
"It took quite awhile to arrive but it finally has. It looks just as advertised. Very happy üòä
"
"This is a very beautiful ring.
"
"First, let me start off by saying customer service was great. I wanted to change my necklace thickness and was able to without any issues. This is the 18‚Äù 0.8MM. It‚Äôs sparkles and shines like crazy. Next, I wanna say shipping was terrible! I know the shop has nothing to do with it after it leaves their hands but omg I was getting worried. Nonetheless, I got it and I love it! I wish I would‚Äôve gotten a longer length but it worked out pretty well :)
"
"I ordered an ‚ÄúR‚Äù for my boyfriend‚Äôs name and I got it today, i put it on my chain and it matches the 14k gold on my chain perfectly I love it ü•∫‚ù§Ô∏è It‚Äôs so cute so worth the money
"
"I was super excited about receiving my ring I received it super early I love my ring just only one One thing I noticed on my ring it look like it‚Äôs been cut off with a curve that supposed to be on the letter M ring I have other than that I love my ring.
"
"Thus is my second time ordering g and they always come through. So this is such a great size I went bigger and I think they are perfect. I will always buy from them. They‚Äôre real because any type of fake breaks out.
"
"Huggies with some twists - literally! They are cute and well made. The hinge location is not even obvious. After placing the order, I was informed immediately on the timeline. Once the huggies were ready, I was notified again about them being shipped. It took less than a week to arrive (US). The box that came with the earrings is really nice too. Additionally, polishing cloth and information card about the huggies are included. Overall, a flawless buying experience. Thank you so much!
"
"these are a little thinner than I expected them to be (as in width) but they are still so gorgeous. They look beautiful in my second and third piercing holes. The twisted-like style seriously elevates the look of any plain hoops next to them, and the quality of the clasp feels sturdy and well-made. Beautiful packaging, and wonderful customer service. Ordering from Dialion was a wonderful experience and I will be purchasing from them again. I absolutely love this shop!
"
"Love this minimalist ring!  I‚Äôve been looking for a solid gold curb chain ring In a price point I could live with, and this was the perfect treat for myself!
"
"This earring is seriously understated and so gorgeous. I bought a single earring and I will probably be purchasing a second earring because of how beautiful it is on. The stones look wonderful, and I love the back on the earring, and the customer service was amazing. The packaging was also very nice and sweet, it was the best experience I have had ordering jewelry online.
"
"These are so lovely to wear, I couldn‚Äôt stop looking down.
"
"very well made!!
"
"A little too malleable . I think theyre cute though
"
"Black paint chips away very quickly...
"
 
"This garnet is perfect, it is perfectly nestled in the setting and I'm in love with it just like all of SilverDynasty's pieces. SilverDynasty is amazing with both their work and their communication, always updating me and letting me know what to expect. I don't plan on buying my rings from anyone else in the future.
"
"This Lapis Lazuli ring is so dainty and beautiful, I am in love with it. SilverDynasty is amazing with both their work and their communication, always updating me and letting me know what to expect. I don't plan on buying my rings from anyone else in the future.
"
"Absolutely in love with this ring! I expected the shipping to take a super long time due to covid and the fact that it was traveling such a long distance to reach me but it arrived very quickly! I ordered my normal ring size and it fits perfectly, is very comfortable and not too heavy and is absolutely beautiful! The craftsmanship is also beautiful I am not worried in the least bit about wearing this ring and having it fall apart at all!
"
 
 
 
 
"These are absolutely stunning, very light and colorful, and dealing with the sellers is a delight. Will be back for more!
"
"Bought these earrings with the pearl and coral and they are beautiful, delicate yet striking. Fab customer service too. Thank you
"
"I LOVE these earrings!  They are so different with the oxidized silver.  Very delicate and I will wear them often.

Thank you!
"
"Lovely, just expected. I already had the earrings and I've wanted to get the matching pendant since then. I'm wearing it right now! Wonderful little shop. Thank you!
"
"Gosh this ring is so cool, I've been wearing it on a necklace chain and fidgeting with it. Thank you for fast shipping and a cool product!
"
"It's gorgeous! I bought it on a whim to help with fidgeting and I love it.
"
"I thought it was going to be more of a ring but I still like it as a fidget toy. very pretty!!
"
"Holy hell this ring is beautiful. It doesn‚Äôt fit me but I‚Äôm not even upset (I bought it knowing it probably wouldn‚Äôt, this is not a complaint about sizing). It looks gorgeous on a necklace and it‚Äôs great for a fidget toy. I always have to be playing with something because of my anxiety, and I can tell this is going to help.
"
"lovely little rings, they look so cute, great for stacking
"
 
 
"Love them so much !!
"
 
 
"Sweet little ring but it‚Äôs tiny, I bought it for my thumb and it‚Äôs too small. It is adjustable but leaves a big gap on my thumb. Would be useful to know approximate ring size (before you adjust it) before purchase. However it‚Äôs nice on another finger. Perfect if you have smaller hands!
"
"Update: 
They quickly emailed me about a new ring since my last one the diamond fell out! Super happy with the customer service! And love that they were so understanding! Definitely recommend! 

Original:Very sad, I‚Äôve only had the ring for a week and the little rhinestone already fell out.
"
"I love the ring. It's really just the way I wanted it, thanks
"
"Thank you! loved the 3 rings i ordered :D
"
"love it! thank you so much :D
"
"Size fits perfectly! love the rings
"
"I have been considering buying this ring for nearly two years now and I'm glad I finally went for it! I wanted something that would stack nicely with my Ahne diamond ring and gold stacking band and decided that this would be different enough to add texture while not detracting attention away from my more statement ring. This ring is perfect for the job. It is very high quality and surprisingly strong considering its adjustable nature. It's also surprisingly flattering considering I have chunky fingers. Thank you again Eni! I already eyeing up my next purchases!
"
"Beautiful and delicate.

I absolutely love this ring, and I know I‚Äôll be wearing it often! I ordered the smallest size and love that I‚Äôm able to wear it on different fingers. 

I also have to mention the packaging. It was lovely, and Eni has incredibly beautiful handwriting! This was such a delightful package to receive. Shipping was on time and the fact that it came all the way from London makes it even more special. Would highly recommend!
"
"Bought this as a keeper ring between my engagement and wedding band. It's the perfect shape and thickness. Great delivery and personalised service! Fab colour, matches my 14k gold band perfectly.
"
"I am completly in love with this ring :D I am already planning to buy more jewels in this shop because it is beautiful, faithful to the images and great quality !  The ring came in a lovely package too.
"
 
"The quality of the ring is great! I love that it's adjustable to fit me perfectly and still looks amazing!
"
"I purchased two rings as gifts. Because they‚Äôre adjustable (to a point), I didn‚Äôt have to worry about size/fit. The quality was very good for the price. I was pleased and the young women I gave them to loved them!
"
"The ring was really pretty but unfortunately, the band snapped after a few weeks of wearing it. I kept the pieces and they make for good ear cuffs if it breaks. The metal bends extremely easily.
"
"Super gorgeous ring for a fabulous price! Love the wiring and the little stone on the ring. It‚Äôs so cute and fits well. It also arrived quicker than I expected. I‚Äôd buy more jewelry from this seller for sure!
"
"Edit: the seller contacted me about the ring size and sent me a new one in case it was the wrong size and a larger one just in case. The new one is perfect! Excellent communication and willingness to make the situation better. Awesome shop. Thanks!  

Ring is smaller than I wanted. I sized up two sizes to wear on my index finger. Still too small. Fits more like an 8/8.5 than a 10. Otherwise beautiful and nice made piece.
"
"It‚Äôs so dainty and beautiful, thank you!
"
"this ring is so so well made and beautiful!!! one of my favorite pieces of jewelry right now,, I'm obsessed:)
"
"I‚Äôm obsessed with this ring. Everything about it is perfect!
"
"I absolutely LOVE this ring!! It‚Äôs even better than I imagined ‚ù§Ô∏è
"
"I really like the ring!! I ordered 2 to go together.  The only thing is that I ordered an 8.5 and it fits more like a 7.5.  I wear them on a different finger than I wanted but I guess that works ‚ù§Ô∏è Otherwise beautiful and SO well made.
"
"Absolutely love my ring with my daughter's birthday on it!  Came beautifully packaged and is the perfect fit. Already put in an order for some earrings next from this shop, Highly recommend!
"
"I just received my stack rings & they are so unique & beautiful. Don‚Äôt think I‚Äôll ever take them off. Will definitely be ordering from this company again!!!  The rings were delivered on time. The seller was very responsive with answers to my questions
"
"Dani was a joy to work with ! I love my rings... they surpassed my expectations üòä
I WILL be back in her shop!
"
"Such a beautiful stacking ring and exactly as pictured. My husband bought it for me to go with my engagement diamond, as my wedding band can sometimes feel a bit flashy to wear with the diamond day-to-day. We got this for me to wear on the other days and it compliments it perfectly! Thank you so much! ‚ú®
"
"Such a  gorgeous, very beautiful ring! It's prettier than I thought:) The ring is well made and unique, perfect work. I'm happy!! 
Dany (the owner/artist) was very responsive and helped a lot with a difficult delivery situation. Thank you so very much :)
"
"This was a 1 year anniversary gift from my boyfriend . I ordered a ‚ÄúMatthew‚Äù ring so I can think of him every time I look down at my hand . Wonderfully made and deffinetly worth the wait . Thanks again for your small business . I love my new ring üíï. Sorry for the blurry photo is doesn‚Äôt do the piece justice .
"
"I finally got my ring , took a while, of course but that‚Äôs because its personalized but it was worth the wait, It‚Äôs simple. I love it, this ring means just more than words,  thank you so much. Just a reminder for me. Wish the words were a little visible though, but all in all. I love & it‚Äôs worth the purchase. Thank you again!
"
"This ring means a lot to me.  It is beautiful and fits well.  a year ago(ish) I almost ended my life.  During that timeframe I accessed Mental Health programming about rewiring my brain and taking accountability to get better through a lot of hard work.  At the time, this day was awful and I never thought I would get better.  But...a year later here I am.  When I found this ring, I put the date on it when I started programming to always remember that life can always change, and we are always capable of getting better.  That day marked the beginning of the rest of my life.  And now I get to wear it on my finger as a self love reminder to myself.
"
"The shipping took longer than what was posted in the shipping details. I was so excited to order this ring... I got my babies name on it as a little momma gift to myself. The ring itself is pretty and very dainty, but it is so hard to read the letters unless it‚Äôs held at just the right angle and lighting. I got it in rose gold.
"
"Love it! Beautifully made, dainty, and shiny. I'm going to buy some more in different sizes so I can mix and match and have sizes that fit the midi area on any finger as well.
"
"Thank you!
Exactly what I wanted, fits perfectly.
"
"Super simple and dainty but  very sturdy.  I never take off my jewelry and this ring seems like it will last a long time! I love it!
"
"This ring is BEAUTIFUL. Simple yet elegant and the packaging was so cute. I love that the box wasn‚Äôt stamped so I can use it again instead of just recycling it. Size was true and I look forwarded to ordering more rings!
"
"Exactly as described. I wanted something small to gently remind me that these times & depression are part of my journey and not my destination. I bought the ""this too shall pass"" ring. It's very beautiful and a perfect reminder of what I need right now. The ring fits perfectly and the lettering is quite clear. As it's a small band, not many can see the letters so it feels like I'm wearing a perfect little secret. I haven't taken it off yet.
"
"I‚Äôve had these little stacking rings, more specifically the Hebrew ‚ÄúThis Too Shall Pass‚Äù, on my wishlist for quite some time and finally decided to treat myself! I was happy to see that they have 1/4 sizes. I have pretty small fingers and size 5 always seem to fit big but I was too reluctant to try a size 4 1/2 ring size. The sizing is perfect! I barely notice it on my finger.

The stacking ring is sweet and dainty, but it feels like it has some sturdiness too! I love how the inside of the ring has the translation on the inside. I can‚Äôt wait to get some more stacking rings from this collection!
"
"This is my third purchase from emilydesign and I'm about to place my fourth.  I have different rings to remind me of what I want to focus on.  For example: I asked for a ring that was engraved with 'thank you' which is a reminder to myself to be thankful in life.   The rings are always beautiful done!
"
"I just received my personalized ring and I love it! The lettering is Hermione. I love how danty and sturdy it is. It pairs perfectly with my other Etsy find. üòä
"
"LOVE. I spent weeks trying to find  simple stacking rings to compliment my wedding ring set and these are perfect! Prep time was as expected, Shipping was slow on the part of USPS.
"
"love love love. I don't like diamond rings or even wide rings without diamonds soni got myself one of these and I love it. simple. just like me üòè thinking about getting another one another size down for my other hand as well. definitely recommend
"
"So sweet! They were beautiful and she sent me two because of shipping difficulties. I really appreciate it I understand how the mail is right now. I‚Äôm a mail carrier. The rings are perfect just what I wanted. You can stack or I wear them together by themselves and they‚Äôre beautiful!
"
"LOOOOOOVE MY RINGS!  They were exactly as pictured and the color of gold is perfect!  Not like the dirty yellow gold I‚Äôve received from other purchases on Etsy.  These are amazing and I can‚Äôt wait to order more!
"
"This ring is so pretty! I got it really fast and I am so in love! Would recommend 100%!!
"
"Absolutely love my ring! I messed up my first order but it was very easy to organize the exchange for the correct jewelry. The gold silver twist ring is gorgeous, and I'm so very happy with how it came out. I'd recommend this shop!
"
"I am a ring fanatic, and this one is BY FAR my favourite!! I wear it every single day. it's so dainty and since it has both silver and gold, it goes with everything. After using the ring sizer that I ordered from LeCubicule, I ordered a size 4 3/4 and the fit is great! The packaging was very cute and secure. I'll definitely be buying more from this seller.
"
"This ring is gorgeous, it is absolutely more beautiful in person than in the photos. My dainty than I expected but so very well made. I love it!
"
"My fourth ring from here and I think it's my favorite!! I purchased the two others in the picture because they're my daughters' birthstones and the heart was just too cute to pass up! When my husband saw them, he loved them too and surprised me with the herkimer one today to add my stack! ‚ù§Ô∏è Fast shipping and beautiful, quality pieces!
"
"I LOVE this ring. I bought as a pinky ring and it looks sooo pretty! I‚Äôm obsessed
"
"The ring I purchased is so cute and dainty. I like it a lot and hope to make more purchases in the future. Really fast shipping too! Got it two days before the expected date. Thank you so much!
"
"I was so impressed with how quickly I received these rings (I ordered 3 total).  I love the dainty raw Herkimer diamond.  The other two stones I purchased are tanzanite and emerald, both raw, and I love how well they stack together.  I like the color of the tanzanite better than the emerald.
"
"From start to finish, the process of getting my ring was fast and easy. The seller sent me messages right away letting me know to contact them should anything go wrong. It got here faster than I thought it would. I love that the ring is adjustable because I can switch which finger it goes on easily. It's so dainty, but still stands out. I will definitely consider this shop for future purchases.
"
"I ordered the Gold tone ring.  It‚Äôs exactly what I was looking for.   Cute ring.   It took 4 weeks before I received the ring.  But it was worth the wait
"
"Beautiful rose gold ring. It's gorgeous. Really happy.
"
"Really like this ring. It's very delicate and is a great simple ring to pair with other rings. Seller shipped it out pretty quickly and messaged me to let me know when to expect it.
"
"Surprisingly shipped fast! It‚Äôs so cute! Danity and definitely something I haven‚Äôt seen! I wore it along with a ring I bought in honor of my baby‚Äôs March birthstone-Aquamarine. Came with a certified diamond certificate, nicely wrapped, boxed and shipped! Worth every earned penny! Thank you!
"
"Absolutely in love, better than what I imagined! I can‚Äôt wait to marry the man I love with this ring!
"
"Absolutely stunning ring. I accidentally ordered the white gold when I meant to purchase yellow gold and the seller was very helpful in terms of exchanging. I had such a positive experience with FiEMMA that I bought another ring set through them which I also adore. Shipping was very quick!
"
"This ring is sooo BEAUTIFUL!!
It looks antique...l love it..
Thank you
"
"Love the hammered effect, which is a bit different, and I wanted something simple for a thumb ring. 

Purchased this and it arrived a little on the tight side, even after I had used a ring sizer. Giorgia offers a free resizing service, I just covered the stamps. 

Would buy again :)
"
"So far I‚Äôve really loved this ring. It‚Äôs nice, simple and exactly what I wanted. I wanted something that didn‚Äôt turn a different colour over time that was also affordable so I‚Äôm waiting to see what happens in a few weeks. I would definitely recommend this item - as it‚Äôs been 2 weeks and I still love it!
"
"I absolutely love my new ring. The size is perfect. The ring is beautifully crafted. I will definitely be shopping from this shop in the future.
"
"My favourite rings!! Delicate, classy, beautiful! And they‚Äôre a lovely colour too - not that horrible brassy yellow colour you get with some gold jewellery! I love that they do inclusive sizing! Giorgia was amazing, I loved my rings when I first purchased them but I got them slightly too big. I asked if there was any chance I could get them resized and it wasn‚Äôt a problem at all and at no additional cost (other than postage obviously). Now whenever I fancy a new ring I come to this shop
"
"I bought this ring for my (adult) daughter's birthday this year. She is definitely one who swims against the current, so I thought that she would get a kick out of it! Well, I was wrong!! She absolutely LOVES the ring, and has vowed never to take it off!!! 
As ordered, the size is a perfect fit. The ring was shipped on-time, and I was kept informed through every step of process. I have only high praise for the VillaSorgenfrei shop on Etsy! Thank you.
"
"Der Ring ist h√ºbsch und hat beim Verschenken Freude gemacht. Er war nicht ganz so wertig, wie gedacht, weitaus schmaler, als erhofft und die kleine Vergoldung ist geringf√ºgiger gearbeitet, als gedacht. Dennoch ein liebevolles kl. Geschenk. Die Geschenkkarte habe ich dann doch  selbst h√ºbscher gestaltet, meine Handschrift ist sch√∂ner- ich hatte auf etwas wirklich Nettes Gedrucktes, Fertiges gehofft, also werbetechnisch Eindrucksvolleres. Aber gut, das handhabt jeder H√§ndler anders. Das hat mich aber nicht √ºberzeugt. Daher 4 von 5 Sternen, da ich da zuletzt von anderen H√§ndlern weitaus mehr verw√∂hnt wurde.  Danke!
"
"Although because of the distance and mail these days, it took a while to get here, but it was worth the wait. It is very, very cute. Looks abstract from a distance but others are delighted when they look closer. Fun, fun ring! Thank you! - LHM
"
"LOVE LOVE LOVE! I call them our ‚ÄúGo your own way‚Äù rings! A little Fleetwood Mac reference! Thank you! I don‚Äôt take mine off!
"
"In love with these rings!! Amazing quality!! I can‚Äôt get over how good they are!! Definitely worth the price!! Thank you x
"
"This ring is just beautiful! And it is easilly adjustable. I'm wearing it night and day :-)
"
"exactly as pictured so the design is super cute, feels very high quality and was lovely and shiny + love the really clever design so it can expand a little bit !! will definitely buy from this shop again
"
"I wear this ring nearly everyday now, it's become my favourite piece that I own. Being able to adjust it for different fingers is a bonus as I can move it according to my preference on the day. The quality is superb and the design is strong but not overpowering. The packaging is just as nice as the products inside!
"
"Received my ring today and I‚Äôm in love, it‚Äôs so dainty and beautiful. Thank you so much.
"
"Soooo cute! I‚Äôm obsessed!
"
"Soooo pretty! This was exactly what I was looking for, I‚Äôm obsessed :)
"
"My ring is so beautiful! I love it so much. The birthstones are both very vibrant and the band is dainty and light.
"
"This ring shipped SO quickly! It is absolutely as delicate, dainty, and beautiful as it is in the picture. I have TINY (and thin) fingers, so this was a welcome addition to my hand. It is everything I wanted and more. I would highly recommend ordering from this shop! Thank you again.
"
"I love my ring! It‚Äôs beautiful and dainty. However, it was a tad too small. I messaged Jamie right away, and with no problems I was able to exchange it for a larger size. I should note that the ring is flexible. It is not solid metal. But I love it!!
"
"I have been looking for a ring like this for quite some time! So happy I‚Äôve finally found it! Loved the note with it too!
"
"Ring is GORGEOUS!! And shipping was crazy fast!! I‚Äôm so happy!
"
"I love my ring. Because it is open, I can easily adjust it and wear it on multiple fingers. It is perfectly dainty.  Though I am in the US and the seller in Portugal, shipping was remarkably fast!
"
"This ring is perfect! It's so dainty and beautiful!! I would definitely recommend this shop. It work about 2 1/2 weeks to arrive which was no big deal for me. I love everything about this ring!
"
"This is my favorite ring! I got the spiral one and I love that it's open so that I can adjust width to whatever finger I'm wearing it on that day. It's beautiful and matches with every outfit. I do wish the moonstones had a bit more shine to them but it's just because of the rough cut of the stones. I can't wait to buy more jewelry from this shop!
"
"It‚Äôs a beautiful ring. I love that the moonstones are not evenly shaped. I chose a rose gold metal, and it looks lovely with the moonstones. It fits perfectly and true to size. 
It was send very quickly and arrived in perfect shape. The seller is absolutely lovely.

Excellent customer service!!!
"
"BEAUTIFUL! Absolutely gorgeous, danty ring. Exactly what I was hoping for :) wearing on my right hand to softly compliment my engagement ring on my left hand for my wedding day! 
Product was shipped and received super fast too. Seller even included a thank you gift, so sweet!!
"
"Fast shipping. Adorable packaging with a kind note from the seller, Laura. This ring is a total stunner! I‚Äôm so in love with it! It‚Äôs high quality and sparkles like crazy. I also loved the free gift I received, which was a nice classy pair of silver hoop earrings. Thank you, Laura!
"
"The ring is really pretty. I needed a ring to take the place of my wedding ring while pregnant and swollen. This one is perfect and it shipped fast! Also received a pretty necklace to match. thanks!
"
"I purchased this ring wanting something pretty and dainty. I normally don‚Äôt wear a lot of rings so it was exactly what I was looking for. After getting the adorable package I opened the handwritten note from Laura with it saying ‚ÄúI grew up down the block from you, what a small world!‚Äù  I never looked at the shop owners name when I made my purchase. Turns out I did grow up down the street from her & her brother and graduated HS with them. So happy to support an old friend and local small business with beautiful jewelry. Xo
"
"Took a bit in shipping, but I was not in a rush so I did not mind. 
These rings are BEAUTIFUL! 
Super stylish, dainty, classy stackable rings. Looks amazing and is quality material. 
Perfect fit. I ordered 3 different sizes to wear on different fingers at same time. 
Exactly what I was looking for. 
I LOVE THEM!!

"I live these rings!!! I bought 3 and they look beautiful alone or mixed in with other bands!
"
"It came so quickly and is just as cute as in the pics. I love how simple this ring is, you can pair it with any other jewelry.
"
"The rose quartz ring was absolutely gorgeous. I‚Äôve been looking for one for a while, and am so glad I came across this shop. I even bought the matching earring studs. Stunning. ‚ù§Ô∏è
"
"I‚Äôve bought two of these rings now and I love them both. They never leave my fingers ü§ç.
"
"These rings are gorgeous! This was my second purchase from LyndyLou - and I love it! It'd gorgeous and petite! Couldn't be happier!
"
"I loved the ring appearance and style except it was a little too big. I ordered my true size but it was falling off my finger. I ended up giving it to my friend and bought a different ring from this same shop. I love the quality of the item so I‚Äôm excited for my new ring to arrive!
"
"So I bought this ring for my boyfriend for Valentine's Day, and I'll say - I was a bit worried. I had no idea how long it would take to ship to Vancouver Island all the way from Ukraine, or how long it would take the seller to make the ring (it says 1-2 weeks on their shop). Well, the seller had it done in about a week, and it began shipping on January 12th. I got it on January 27th, which I think is very good shipping time considering the distance. I peeked at the ring and it is absolutely gorgeous - I know my boyfriend will love it! It was a really good price considering some of the comparisons of other shops, too! Overall, very impressed üòä It comes in a nice box, too!
"
"I bought this ring for my fianc√©. It was what he wanted for a wedding ring. The idea of it is so lovely, and this ring was so beautifully made. I highly recommend this gorgeous ring made by VyTvir.  Down to the wrapping and presentation.  It‚Äôs all perfect. It will be so special for our wedding day. The picture is of the 5mm width.
"
"I am SO impressed with this ring! It is lightweight and polished beautifully. The personalization was exact. I can't believe how quickly I received this! I live in the U.S. and I got it within a week! The craftsman(or woman)ship is remarkable. I am excited to gift this & order more unique jewelry. I love this shop!
"
"Came in today. The ring looks beautiful! The color is slightly lighter than pictured. Fits comfortably. Well polished. Packaged well. My only complaint is that it took a long time to come in, though, I know it was coming from the Ukraine. Natalie was extremely quick to answer any questions and helped with tracking. Would absolutely recommend and order from Natalie again in the future.
"
"The obsession is real.. I use this ring as the top of my stackable and I‚Äôm in love!
"
"Love love this ring. Reminds me of the view I have been looking at my whole life. Shipped in a timely manner and love that this Etsy shop is local to the PNW!
"
"I absolutely love these rings! I did two stackables with the Mountain style and they turned out great. The fit to size and make me happy üòä
"
"I'm officially in love with this ring! üíô
"
"Everything about this order was perfect and exceeded my expectations. The designer, Alon, communicated with me me throughout the process and even helped me make some adjustments and very personalized piece. 

The necklace arrived yesterday and it‚Äôs gorgeous! Exactly what I wanted. The chain  is stunning and the letters are tiny and exactly the size I wanted. The piece is so fine and just beautiful. I‚Äôm so happy! And with the express shipping it arrived in less than a week from Israel to NY.  

Thank you so much Alon! I love it!
"
"This is a beautiful ring. It is EXACTLY what I was hoping for. The letter 'M' 
in old English font is the perfect look and because it signifies my daughter's name, it means so much more to me. Thank you Alon for this amazing ring and for quickly replying to my questions.  I highly recommend this shop! .... and it even arrived way earlier than expected.
"
"Alon provided me with great customer service, was incredibly helpful & sent such a lovely little note in the package that made the experience purchasing from this small business so special! The ring fits perfectly* and is beautifully engraved with such quality, intention, and detail. 10/10 and would love to purchase from him again.
"
"Got this as a gift for my sister. She absolutely loved it ! She said it‚Äôs so unique and beautiful! I got the word for love in Hebrew engraved on the top of the ring. Thank you so much !!
"
"My Baby Boy Is My Everything ! You Can Say I'm An Obsessed Fur Mommy ! üíö I Absolutely LOVE This Ring Specially Worn With My Engagement Ring !
"
"Oh this was beyond what I expected! After losing my sweet Gigi, I wanted a simple but heart found piece of jewelry that I could wear and never worry about taking off. My first reaction was to the tiny bag that it was packaged in because of the little note that said ‚Äúhand made with love‚Äù. Beautiful presentation. Then the ring itself was absolutely perfect. Been wearing it since June 11 and it‚Äôs still absolutely perfect. Durable. Comfortable. Simple. You will love yours. Highly, highly recommend. Thank you ‚ù§Ô∏è
"
"I ordered way too big but I‚Äôm making it work because I‚Äôm OBSESSED with this ring. So sweet and good quality.
"
"Love love love! It came unexpectedly early which was a nice surprise! It's so comfy on my finger, beautifully shiny and the weight of it is perfect.  Goopie (who's name is on it) also approves!!
"
"Wow quick shipping!  I ordered two rings a stone and an initial. The size of the stone and initial was what I expected small but not minuscule, though the initial was a little bigger than expected which is nice.  The ring size i was a little nervous about but it was spot on (a 9). Luckily my fingers were a little swollen and they still fit great. I work outside and wanted something to protect a ring, my lucky ring, that I've worn since I was 12, roughly 46 yrs, (it tends to slide off in the cold), these fit wonderfully. I'll be buying more ""protectors"" in the near future!
"
"I love these rings! They are exactly how I hoped they would be!
"
"The ring is beautiful! I just love it. I‚Äôve gotten so many compliments on itü•∞
"
"my wife loved these rings!.. only down side is now I have to buy another 2 rings (initial, and stone) because we are expecting another baby.. haha!

thanks again!
"
"Exactly what I was looking for to stack with this little flower ring I have.
"
"Really, really pretty! They look great, worn together or apart!
"
"Was very happy with my purchase! I would definitely purchase from them again!
"
 
"Always love what I order from this seller! My order was delivered sooner than I expected, and it was packaged beautifully. It‚Äôs very dainty but catches the eye. Excited to give to my sister!
"
"Have ordered total of 3 rings from Caitlin. Such a great shop owner! The zodiac ring was a little big but was able to be adjusted with just a slight squeeze.
"
"The ring is so beautiful, it makes me want to have another one. I‚Äôve already gotten a few compliments on it.
"
"All rings came out beautifully!
"
"they are so adorable omg
"
"It looks even prettier in person and the quality is good! Plus shipping was fast. However, the ring was still too big on me despite being able to adjust it. I am typically a size 4 in rings so I was hoping this would work for me. It does kinda fit on my thumb but I need to pinch the ring really far in and I‚Äôm afraid it‚Äôs going to break. Overall, I‚Äôll recommend and I‚Äôll be buying for gifts instead!
"
"The rings reach far beyond my expectations. I am so impressed with how feminine and dainty they are. I just
Can‚Äôt stop looking at it on my hand. I can‚Äôt imagine you topping it. Simple and elegant, that‚Äôs the only way to describe. I love ‚ô•Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù£Ô∏èüéàit. Thank you.
"
"Super cute and seems durable, looks even better then in the pictures, has a nice shine üòá
"
"Really Pretty rings and they fit perfect! Look just like the picture! X
"
"Just received the anklet. It is so beautiful, in real looks even better than on the picture. Liked it very much! Plus, very cute postcard letter! Thank you! :)
"
 
 
"The ring is so cute and I find it really good to help distract me from picking my skin, I got it with the pink beads and the colour is so nice love it <3
"
"I‚Äôm in love! It‚Äôs so cute and fits perfect. Highly recommend.
"
"These products were absolutely incredible. I‚Äôm a huge fan of dainty jewelry so these were perfect for me. They were well made and are easily adjusted for different fingers. Really happy with these products. You also included a free ring which I really appreciated, and wear all the time. I will definitely be buying from you again. Keep up the good work !! :)
"
"This ring is super cute and works well as a small fidget. I bought the one with colored beads and unfortunately have already seen the paint wear off after only a few days of fidgeting with the beads. Otherwise it is holding up well. I like that it is adjustable for any finger. Thanks!
"
"I absolutely love my ring ‚ù§Ô∏èThe packaging is so pretty and clean! I was really nervous to buy a ring online and risk that it didn‚Äôt fit but my ring fits perfectly. This ring and these coordinates help me get closer to my mom. She passed away six years ago and I live several states away from her grave. I couldn‚Äôt be happier! Thank you so much!
"
"Note: not showing the whole ring for safety purposes. ü•∞ // I just got this in the mail, immediately put it on and simply ADORE it! Perfect size, flawless craftsmanship, and I can‚Äôt stop looking at IT, haha. What was also lovely was the little instructional guide on how to actually take care of sterling silver. I think we tend to assume that it‚Äôs just indestructible - but it needs care and attention like any other piece of jewelry. Love love love this so much. ‚ù§Ô∏è
"
"This ring is beautiful! It was made exactly the way that I requested, however the ring is a little thicker than the photo- this is not something that I mind, though. Also took a little bit to ship but its not a problem! Would recommend buying from this shop. Could tell that it will last me for a very long time!
"
"Just the perfect thing to be sure my girls (two gorgeous mutts) are always with me.
"
"The quality of this ring is great--very dainty and pretty, just what I was looking for. Unfortunately, it's just a little big for my size. But I still really like it and am pleased with the sale--the seller was fast and responsive and the ring itself is lovely.
"
"The ring is such good quality and so cute! The seller is also so very nice and the shipping was super fast !!! Definitely worth it :)
"
"So cute and dainty!! I'm obsessed with this ring! üòçüòçüòç
"
"I LOVE THIS RING!!!! So tiny and cute, my new favorite ring! :-)
"
"So gorgeous! I got this ring to remember the baby I miscarried at the end of last year. It‚Äôs so much prettier in person! The sizes seem to run small.. I was hoping to wear it on my middle finger (so I sized up to 8.5), but it fits snug on my ring finger (size 7). It‚Äôs not a big deal to me though. Packaging is beautiful too. Happy with this purchase!
"
"Super cute and dainty! It's just what I wanted. Very shiney but not to flashy. I personalized with my father's birthday.  It's a perfect reminder he is always with me. I just ordered a bracelet for my mom! Hope its here for mothers day. It took a while to ship which was expected since its handmade. Worth the wait!
"
"I purchased this ring for my mom for Mother‚Äôs Day and she loved it! It‚Äôs so sweet and dainty. I honestly thought it was a bit smaller than I had anticipated but it still looked great! The shop was super easy to contact. All of my questions were answered very kindly and I had no issues at all! Thank you for the lovely product and amazing service. Just put in a new order for myself can‚Äôt wait!
"
"Purchased this as an anniversary gift and my girlfriend loved it. Very sturdy! I anticipated a decent product, but what I received was much more than I expected! It was so pretty in the box and even prettier on her finger. (The packaging was also super cute! Good job, Dad!) Thank you!
"
"Great looking pine tree ring - looks great - feels comfortable on finger - goes fantastic with other stacking rings!  Many thanks to artist/seller for super prompt transaction.  Will very much enjoy wearing these rings!  Two thumbs up craftmanship!
"
"Beautiful ring!!
"
"She shipped out of her usual scehdule to make sure it got here for my anniversary. Thank you!
"
"I highly recommend ordering products from EbonyandSparrow! Not only is her work spectacular, she is a great artist to work with; I had a shipping error that was entirely my fault, and she was very communicative and accommodating in resolving the issue. Thank you, EbonyandSparrow!

"Super cute!! Took about a month to get delivered but it‚Äôs okay. My fingers are so difficult to find a good ring size because my knuckles are bigger then my fingers, so it was a tad big. But super pretty! Thank you!
"
"I love this ring! I have received so many compliments and I‚Äôve only worn it a handful of times. The only drawback was that I waited 2 months for the ring to arrive. However, the seller was extremely helpful and eager to make things right. I would definitely recommend!
"
"Absolutely in love with my ring xx
"
"Love this ring, I‚Äôve gotten so many compliments on it! I‚Äôve been wearing it almost everyday and it still seems to keep its shine and it really is quality work. It did take a little long to get here but it came quickly by Covid Standards if you think about it because I live in the US and it was shipped from another country. I would continue buying from this seller they have great quality work!!
"
"Beautiful and just as pictured! These look gorgeous each individually, as a set, or mixed with my other stacking rings. Just what I was looking for!
"
"I adore these rings. They are perfect for every day. I have a set from a year ago and they're still in great condition. I sadly misplaced two of them on a recent vacation, and now I just have 6 stacked and the old ones look as good as the new ones! Highly, highly recommend.
"
"These are by far my favorite new rings!  Delicate and beautiful!
"
"Absolutely love these rings and the little polishing cloth! :)
"
"I literally almost cried when I saw it. Looks exactly like the one my dad got me when I was a child and lost. My heart is filled! I can‚Äôt thank you enough üíóüíóüíóüíó

Excellent quality and even better customer care! Love, love, love!
"
"Completely in love with my new ring.
"
"I love this ring so much!! Its very high quality, came within a week or a week and a half, and is perfect for a ring lover like me. It fits well on a pinkie or a ring finger. Comes exactly how it‚Äôs advertised. I highly recommend this!
"
"I love it and it was in the cutest packaging. really personal and neat. would definitely order from again!! (edit after having it for a weekend, it does leave a green tint to my skin, just a warning. still a sturdy piece though!)
"
"Thank you so much! This is a beautiful ring - I love it! It looks better in person than I expected from the photos. Fast delivery and lovely packing. I‚Äôm very happy!
"
"So this is my second engagement ring, we got it to match my fianc√©‚Äôs wedding band since his is grey/black with black diamonds + rose gold trim. It‚Äôs so beautiful in person and people love it! 
I put a photo of the 2 ct. salt and pepper ring with rose gold alongside my original ring (not from etsy) which is a .65 center white diamond for comparison. My ring size is a 3.5. The seller was very nice and sent me a video and photo of the diamond she would use.
"
"I can‚Äôt stop staring at my new engagement ring! Honestly it‚Äôs one of the prettiest rings I‚Äôve ever seen. My fianc√© is very proud of it and I‚Äôm a very happy fianc√©e. He says his favorite part is how much I love it. Lena was amazing and patient answering all our questions about fitting it with wedding bands we had from my grandma. She even gave us a little sneak video to help with our excitement (though to be honest it was all my excitement)!  Shipping was incredibly fast! I hear nothing but compliments when people notice my ring!
"
"Love love love love love. The top photo shows the contrast in direct sunlight, and the bottom is inside. Depending on the lighting the grey will be more pronounced. (The colors seen in the bottom photo are from a stained glass window reflecting nearby!) I absolutely love this ring and am so glad we chose to order from Lena. She answered any and every question I had and the ring took only 3 days to arrive once shipped. After spending weeks looking for a salt and pepper diamond, I was thrilled to come across this listing. If you are even considering a salt and pepper diamond, do not hesitate to inquire about this beauty!
"
"Exaclty as pictured! I get so many compliments on this ring
"
"I bought this band to stack with the moonstone ring and it‚Äôs just perfect. This seller is a dream to work with!
"
"This ring is inSANELY beautiful. The detail in the swirls is so tiny yet so intricate! This is a gorgeous ring that will likely be a daily wear for me!
"
"I fell in love with this design after buying the labradorite ring.  I just had to have this as a single band.
"
"This ring is very pretty and well made, and I had an excellent customer service experience with the shop owner! I originally ordered this ring with the matte finish. I wanted to stack it with other rings I have, so I realized I should have ordered the shiny finish. I was able to send the ring back to have it refinished, I also had it sized down slightly. All I had to do is pay for the shipping. I am really happy with my purchase and with the experience I had with the shop!
"
"The ring is perfect. It‚Äôs exactly what I was looking for. Great quality and a great price! Thanks!
"
"This is a really pretty ring. I look forward to stacking it with others.
"
"Really cute! fits true to size
"
"Really pretty, just love them !
"
"Great communication, perfect rings ! Size is good.

"Hi Irene

Thanks for the ring, it was beautifully packed and i love it, only thing is that it a wee bit small, lol, i checked it with my other rings, its the same size...it can only fit my last finger, which i wanted to use on my 4th finger, nevermind its okay, keeping it as i love the pattern, but will order another one soon...wohoooo
"
"I love my ring! It came in a week & was perfect! I get so many compliment!
"
"Absolutely love this ring! 
As a nature and art lover it was a perfect buy. Sizing was perfect. Couldn't be happier with it. Something to bring you joy in such difficult times. ‚ù§üåø
"
"this ring is so beautiful. I will say, buy a half size or a size up if yoy aren't sure. But they are so beautiful. And the customer service through AlpacaBlue was amazing. Very kind! Will definitely buy from this company again!!
"
"LOVE my ring. Definitely dainty. So lightweight that I often don‚Äôt feel it on - which is just what I had hoped for. Beautiful jem setting too! Thank you!!
"
"I received this ring in a timely manner for shipping over seas. The ring is beautiful and dainty. I got it to match another ring and it looks great!
"
"Increible! Delicado, bonito, elegante, el trato maravilloso, me encanta la tienda y los articulos que tienen, super recomendada son super amables y encantadores
"
"I love these rings so much üòç Shipping took a while bc I‚Äôm in the US but they were worth the wait! They‚Äôre beautiful and good quality. Will buy from here again soon!
"
"Very fast shipping for a beautiful ring. Perfect size, thin band. Beautiful, simple design!
"
"Love the ring, great quality and loved the quick shipping !!
"
"Beautiful, correctly sized, really well made. I wear it almost everyday.
"
"Really pretty, I haven't taken it off since I got it. Beautiful white enamel, I've gotten compliments from all my coworkers.
"
"I‚Äôm shocked at how much I love these rings!! I got two, size 8, and they are absolutely perfect!!
"
"Love my birthstone rings. I got 2 to stack for myself and son. The stones are a lot more smaller than i thought but they look super cute and dainty regardless. Happy with them!
"
"So chic and simple! Exactly what I was looking for! Love my rings!
"
"So chic and simple! Exactly what I was looking for! Love my rings!
"
"Okay, I love this ring SO MUCH. Its cute online/in photos but it‚Äôs even better in person. So dainty and beautifully made. I genuinely want to buy more and stack them and that‚Äôs not generally an inclination of mine. My fingers are tiny and I feel like most rings overwhelm them (sounds weird, but whatever) and this just makes me feel good. Highly recommend!
"
"I love this ring. I was wanting something small and this is so dainty. I should have ordered it at least half a size bigger than I normally wear because it does run a little smaller. I ordered this ring Oct 9th and received it on Oct 15th, so it was shipped fast.
"
"I love this ring. Super dainty but still feels sturdy enough that I don‚Äôt worry about it bending out of shape. Stone color is very deep. I love the hammered look of the band; it adds dimension and character without making it seem less nice of a ring. The fit was perfect, too. I was looking for something that I could wear that with a fun, simple stack that was still elegant enough to go on a hand with my engagement and wedding rings. And we have a winner
"
"Very cute. The ring looks just as advertised. Production before shipping took 7 days, but shipping was fast and actually arrived a day early! This ring is perfect for a dainty mother‚Äôs ring with my sons birthstone.
"
"for the price not bad but I don't think I realized how small the ring actually was! a little different then what I was expecting but still a good buy!! I try to wear rose quartz every day and this ring is a nice addition to my collection
"
"did fit me but gave it to a friend and they love it sooo thanks ig haha
"
"This ring is absolutely beautiful, it goes well for a dainty look. Although it took a while to get here it was worth it, its become one of my favorite rings to wear
"
"such a gorgeous ring and fits like a dream!!
"
"My ring is BEAUTIFUL‚ù§ I ordered one with my husband initials and uses it on my wedding finger. LOVE LOVE LOVE IT. Really stands out. Great packaging and shipped fast. I will definitely be ordering again
"
"Oh my goodness!! This ring is just beautiful!! I‚Äôm very impressed at how it looks! I will definitely be back to buy more from this store. From purchasing to delivery it took 9 days!!üòÄ
"
"I am so glad I bought this ring, also looks better even in person.
"
"Perfect!! I‚Äôm in love with this ring!
"
"Gorgeous work! I‚Äôve had this ring on my wishlist for over a year, and the beauty and quality was well worth the wait!  Not only is Amy‚Äôs work worth it, she is super nice! I really appreciated her double checking that I read the size warming, because it does get tighter than a single band due to the stacking! Took her advice and went up a size and it fits perfect, even when I‚Äôm puffy from the heat. Time to a few more ofher pieces to my Christmas wish list! I will be buying from her again!
"
"This ring set is beautiful - perfect as my ""vacation wedding ring""!  Make sure you order up... my diamond wedding set is a 8.25 and Amy worked with me to get sized at a 9.  It fits perfectly!!!  

Additionally, I outfitted my entire bridal party with bracelets by Amy.  The workmanship is incredible and the uniqueness of each bracelet with a touch of personalization with a monogram was a perfect gift for the ladies.  

Excellent customer service and fast responses to email queries.  Will definitely be my go-to for future jewelry.
"
"This Stacking ring is absolutely gorgeous. Although I have to have the ring upsized Amy and Liz are taking good care of me.
If you order this ring be sure to purchase a larger size than you normally wear. I wear an 8.5 and I'm having the ring upsized to a size 9 so I can wear it on different fingers. You won't be disappointed with this ring. Once it's upsized I can't wait to wear it!!!
"
"Love the rings! The worksmanship is excellent.  The hardest part is to decide how to wear them - one at a time, a mix of metals or all at once!  Thanks to Amy Waltz for getting the sizing perfect.  If worn all at once, they create a wide band and sizing up 1/2 to 1 full size is a good idea.
"
 
"Super cute! Didn't realize How small my guages were LOL. BUT I still like them! I thought I knew my guage but this are a tad bit big and can not get them in BUT thats ok!! I am going to keep on trying to get them in LOL
"
"I have been eye balling this store for a solid while now. Especially with covid, I was nervous about shipping times seeing as it's based out of the country. It was about 3 weeks, but so so so worth the wait. Customer service is top notch! I had no complaints, and didn't reach out, but was kept alerted to every single update. Shipping estimate, tracking number, everything I received an email. These plugs are incredibly beautiful, perfect inch and a half. So unique and dainty and feminine! ADORABLE! 10000/10 recommend. Will 100% be a return customer!
"
"i bought these for prom and i love them!! they‚Äôre high quality and absolutely gorgeous. i‚Äôm a size 00g so i was afraid that the crystals would be too closely packed to look good, but i took the chance on buying them and i‚Äôm so glad i did! shipping was fast and the packaging was really nice. they even included how to care for the plugs and a warning that water might damage them ! i don‚Äôt have a good picture of the plugs, but even a good picture could never show how gorgeous these plugs are in person!
"
"Love this ring! I‚Äôm not normally a fan of resin rings but I saw this one and fell in love! The coloring is gorgeous and looks exactly like the picture! Shipping was also fast!
"
"Was a bit darker than the picture made it seem but held up pretty well for the most part. After about six months of daily use the silicone began to break on the edges a little, but nothing too noticeable. Very pretty! Got lots of compliments on it and still love and wear it!
"
"This ring is gorgeous! I had my eye on it for so long and I'm so glad I finally up and bought it!
I was a little scared because some of the reviews were saying it's darker then the pictures listed, but the one I got is just as I had hoped! (Judge for yourself, but I included a pic because it seems just as discribed to me.)
"
"Beautiful piece. I bought this to be my wedding band when I can‚Äôt wear my big rings, and it‚Äôs just the right amount of sparkle to feel special. Very quick delivery for having come from overseas.
"
"I love my new ring so much!!  Will definitely be recommending and probably will be ordering from this account again.  I never want to take  it off :)))
"
"Olga did an AMAZING job on my custom ring and it came SO QUICKLY, I couldn't believe it.
I would totally order from her again.  The ring is made SO WELL.  I'm thrilled.
"
"I absolutely Love this ring, it shipped on time...Its beautiful!! Its dainty, but sturdy, very well made and just glows! I have gotten so many compliments in it.
Thank you so muchüíóüòÅ
"
"Overall I am super pleased with this ring! When I originally purchased it was a bit too big but Olga was very willing to let me exchange it for a smaller size. I did have to pay for shipping again but I‚Äôd say it was worth it. I have received so many compliments from it already and I‚Äôve only been wearing it for a few weeks. I will add that the area under the opal itself isn‚Äôt 100% flat and is raised where the band touches/is fused, but personally this doesn‚Äôt bother me. I hope the picture I added helps show this.
"
"Shipped fast and came with adorable packaging. The rings fit super comfortably and I wear them all the time! I forget I‚Äôm wearing them half the time. I highly recommend these rings for people looking for delicate and comfortable jewelry.
"
"Thank you! Beautiful made ring!
"
"Great quality, fast shipping. I love my new rings!!
"
"Great quality, fast shipping. I love my new rings!!

"I love so much my new ring :)  the quality ist very good and the ring is delicate as on the fotos.

"Absolutely in love ü§ç

"I loooove the bracelet! It's so so beautiful and dainty and the quality is just perfect :) It arrived really fast and the packaging was very cute :) Thank you!
"
"J'adore ! You've done it again, Bere. üíã
"
"Tr√®s jolie bague, j'ai juste fait une petite erreur de taille et du coup l'ai recommand√©e en plus petit ;)
Un grand merci et bon No√´l !!
"
"The ring is beautiful and fits perfectly. It was sent really quickly :) thanks a loooot I love it üéâ
"
"Tr√®s joli, re√ßu en temps et en heure. Vendeuse tr√®s agr√©able. Je recommande !
"
"It was love at first sight when I saw this ring on Etsy. I couldn't stop thinking about it , it actually kept me up at night due to my excitement! I couldn't wait for the shop to come back from vacation.  I ordered right away and I anxiously waited for it's transatlantic trip to me.  It is gorgeous.  It fits perfectly and is so comfortable.  I love that the delicate beauty of nature can be captured in such a realistic way. Thank you for a incredibly beautiful ring.
"
"Gorgeous! I get lots of compliments! I where to this to the hospital so I don't get my engagement ring dirty.
It's a little cloudier than the photos but still pretty.
"
"After most of my jewelry was stolen, I wanted a daily ring. I absolutely love this ring, and it's exactly what I needed. Comfortable, fits perfectly, and so adorable! Thank you so much, I will definitely be ordering more jewelry in the future!
"
"Absolutely beautiful, stunning flower ring. So pleased and exactly what I wanted/hoped for based on photos and reviews. Excellent communication with Buttonsy when double checking my order details. The ring arrived fantastically boxed, with peppermint tea, dried flowers, some wild flower seeds and a lovely flower badge in a 'Thank you' bag. 
So happy, will be purchasing more. Couldn't have asked for a better experience.
"
"This ring is exactly what I wanted. I love that it is a diamond without being a DIAMOND. It provides a delightful blue spark next to my wedding band (a placeholder, not a replacement, for an engagement ring I haven't been able to wear for years). Best of all I can wear it all the time. It never snags or gets in the way at all.

The blue color is very striking, almost a blue-green. Much brighter than I was expecting.

While I wear it with my 5mm wide wedding band and it does get lost a bit, I still find it absolutely perfect for me. On a finger by itself it's so impressive I think I will have to save my pennies and come back for the tiny red diamond to wear on the right hand!
"
"Oh my goodness!!! I‚Äôve been looking forward to this ring and I open up the packaging... and IT‚ÄôS PERFECT!!! I love the color, the size, EVERYTHING! FMJ was so helpful and her packaging was wonderful. Truly an amazing purchase. My only tiny complaint is I‚Äôve had it on for like 5 minutes and theres already a tiny little scratch on the ring, but other than that it‚Äôs amazing. Thank you, FMJ, I love it!

"Second diamond ring purchase from this store for me. I love the quality and the craftsmanship. I‚Äôve gotten so many compliments on them, and they‚Äôre just the tiniest bit of bling to add to my minimalist jewelry. So in love with them, wish I could wear them all!
"
"I love the ring! For some reason I thought I ordered the black diamond version, so was a little surprised when I opened the parcel, but pleasantly so! I love the colour of the gemstone, and the size is perfect for stacking. I've bought other rings from Full Moon Jewelry before, and I really love the quality and designs.
"
"Great little dainty band. I‚Äôm not to into big bridal sets so this works as an accent to my engagement ring rather than competing for attention. It also looks fantastic alone and will be comfortable at the gym.
"
"Perfect perfect perfect. I cannot even begin to explain how perfect this ring is! It works great as a spacer ring! I was worried it was too thin and messaged Julie. She responded promptly with a solution! I ended up keeping the 1mm and resizing my wedding band instead. Thank you so much Julie!
"
"This is perfect just what I was wanting. I order up .25 and it glides on my finger so easily. It looks just like Mila Kunis wedding band and I love it so much. It even came in a tarnish prevention bag. If your looking for a simple yet elegant wedding band get this one!
"
"Before i got this, it took some time because i am from a different country from the seller, but no worries because the seller is very accommodating to your concerns and will try to help you with it! When i finally got the item, it is sure pretty! It is very sleek! Very shiny and smooth! It is exactly the same size i ordered too! Apart from that, she gave me a free gift as a surprise! I usually don‚Äôt like surprises but this one was good! Thank you!!
"
"Absolutely stunning, bought two .. one for my sister and one for me.. super cute. Arrived really quickly and loved the packaging. Thank you so much
"
"Holly & Maya have a wonderful selection of jewellery and it was hard to pick just one ring.  It's lovely and great quality. Love the little heart charm and it sparkles in the light. It was wrapped beautifully and arrived with a personal thank you note.  Delivery was fast and the service friendly.  Would recommend a visit as there are lovely items to choose from.  They make great gifts.
"
"Beautiful ring and it came in such a lovely box , beautiful packaging üëç
"
"Love love love .. all the pieces I have purchased have been amazing
"
"I absolutely love it! Appears like super good quality, looks exactly like the picture, and it‚Äôs just beyond adorable! I smile every time I see the shiny little daisies!

Also, I have small, thin fingers, and this ring is the perfect fit! Doesn‚Äôt overwhelm my hand at all!
"
"It is definitely a cute and dainty ring and I wear it every day. It shipped quickly and got to me quickly!
"
"Looks good but not my stile, hat to return.
"
"Quick delivery and very pretty ring. Love it!
"
"Thank you so much for these! I seem to be wearing a couple of these constantly with my rotation! They're really nice and haven't stained my fingers!
"
"I love these rings! Thanks!
"
"Love them al!! Thank you so much
"
"We had a few issues with the delivery so they ended up being quite delayed but all the issues were handled extremely well!! The rings are so cute and really good quality xx
"
"Absolutely love this ring! It is a little smaller then the picture seemed to show but I love it anyway, it's really delicate.
"
"Absolutely adore this ring ***** gorgeously made and beautiful x
"
"Beautiful and delicate ring. Exactly how i wanted it to be. Despite the band being thin, it feels sturdy and of good quality. I would not hesitste to buy again from Suzanne!
"
"Just perfect - a delicate little ring, beautifully made. Looks great alone or stacked with others. Great communication from the seller - thanks!
"
"Gorgeous ring! Was looking for something that's similar to my engagement ring (need it for daily wear) - this is perfect. Got the right sizing too. Very happy with my purchase. (:
"
"This is ring is gorgeous! I love the deep blue of the sapphire. Sometimes the blue can be to light or too dark. This is ring is just perfect. The ring also has all this beautiful detail all around the medal of the ring. Would definitely buy from this seller again.
"
"My husband ordered this ring as my wedding ring and it is absolutely stunning. I'm in love.
"
"This ring looks lovely online but in person is breathtaking.  The craftsmanship is crisp and finished.  I bought this for my neice and envision her cherishing it for her lifetime.  Very beautiful ring.
"
"Perfection! I love these dainty rings. Perfect for stacking! Thank you! ‚ù§Ô∏è
"
"I ordered these to add to my collection, These I added to my toe rings they are beautiful. I get compliments all the time. I have 7 on my middle finger between my knuckle and nail too so they match.  I refer people to you all the time.  Just love your stuff.  Very reasonably priced very well made so I can purchase more of what I Love.  Thank you.
"
"OBSESSED. Thank you sooooo much! Amazing work. Can‚Äôt wait to order again soon! Xoxoxox
"
"Bought this ring to replace one I previously owned. I wear this ring as part of my wedding band and this was a perfect replacement! Beautiful ring, perfect fit and shipped/arrived to me quickly!
"
"I have bought 2 sets (one year apart each) and the old set looks just as sweet as the new one! I never take these rings off and I get compliments regularly. I love them so much! Fantastic shipping and great shop owner. The only thing is that these rings are thinner then I‚Äôm used to and they bend a little but I also work with my hands a lot so it‚Äôs more my issue then the rings. Thank you so much!
"
"Always beautiful like expected. I‚Äôve purchased a few times now, each time is fast, nicely made and study yet dainty. I‚Äôve been wearing some for over a year now and they are something I never take off. I‚Äôm extremely grateful for the note left, it‚Äôs very personable and sweet. Thank you again for one of my favorite things! I‚Äôll be purchasing again soon! Xo
"
"Oh my goodness! I'm in love with these rings! I am coming back very soon to get more. Thank you so so much!
"
"Yet again BEAUTIFUL! Shiny, fast shipping, good customer service! Wearing 7 now currently and am never taking them off! Thank you again so much! More than love! I'll be ordering more soon! Xoxo
"
"The ring is beautiful ü§© It is definitely dainty in a really skinny band sort of way & the diamonds are TINY. However my first impression was ‚Äúthis was a horrible purchase - my fingers size 9 are chubby and I wanted something that did not emphasize the thickness of them. That being said I quickly fell inlove with the ring. I wanted a ring I could wear everyday instead of my engagement ring üíç. Working from home I do not feel the need to keep banging my engagement ring with the desk or keyboard. But I also wanted something that when I am on Zoom call or working and doing calls, the sparkle could catch my eye & make Feel butterflies. I love the shine and glimmer of the diamonds. It is so Comfortable!!! With taxes this ring cost about $315. I asked local jewelers and they quoted me $400-600. This would make a great gift üéÅ
"
"I had my eye on this cluster ring for a while, but was nervous to take the plunge. However, once it went on sale, I knew I couldn't resist! Shipping was fast, and it arrived in beautiful and secure packaging. I ordered a size 7, and it fits just sliiightly looser than a few other rings of the same size that I own, but otherwise it looks and feels great! Even my mom, who is the most difficult person to impress when it comes to jewelry, thought it was very pretty. For comparison sake, I put it next to a photo of a fake diamond ring that I own. It shouldn't be hard to spot the Ferkos one--it's much shinier! ;)
"
"I bought this as a celebration for a milestone. It came quickly (in a nice box) and it is beautiful. It‚Äôs shinier than I thought it would be (and pictures don‚Äôt capture it well -it‚Äôs been overcast and dark). 
The metal itself was a little bit thicker than I was expecting, but that‚Äôs down to me not reading the description (and the diamonds are slightly larger too - so I can‚Äôt really complain, haha)! 
The ring has a very low profile, which I love since I‚Äôm apt to hit rings on just about anything.
"
"I‚Äôm in love with this ring. I wanted to buy myself something nice that I could wear every day and I found the perfect piece! It‚Äôs so much more interesting than a plain diamond band, a good price, and great quality. I highly recommend this seller and this ring.
"
"LOVE! I really hope this ring lasts a long time because I'm obsessed with it! But like other comments have said, it is a little smaller than I expected. Also, very fast shipping! I ordered on a Friday and received on the following Wednesday.
"
"The pic does not do this ring justice. It is absolutely stunning!!! I have gotten so many compliments. Thank you so much for my beautiful ring.
"
"Absolutely in love with my new ring!! It shipped so fast and completely matched the photos (no false shininess). The fit is perfect and true to size also! I couldn't be happier with my product or the service! I will definitely be shopping here again soon!
"
"Love this ring!!! The pictures do not do it justice!  It is absolutely gorgeous!  I will definitely be ordering from this company again!
"
"my first shipment of these were stolen in the mail.  the seller kindly sent me another pair!  the earrings are now in regular rotation and i completely love them.  compliments all the time!
"
"I love this ring! Valerie also made me a second ring with a red garnet and the two stacked together look beautiful.
"
"i'm still in love with it. such fantastic work, & arrived packaged so beautifully. this ring & i have both received the best care from its seller. thank you!!
"
"Got this item quick and it's perfect! My partner is so excited and we fully intend on returning to this shop when we need new rings!
Thank you!
"
"These rings are GREAT! Has taken my stack to the next level. Love them thanks so much.
"
"Perfect rings as describe. Thank you Dany!
"
"Beautifully made rings, very happy with them and great service thank you.
"
"Such a beautiful stacking ring and exactly as pictured. My husband bought it for me to go with my engagement diamond, as my wedding band can sometimes feel a bit flashy to wear with the diamond day-to-day. We got this for me to wear on the other days and it compliments it perfectly! Thank you so much! ‚ú®
"
"Super gorgeous piece. I really love it a lot. It came very quickly and is super unique!
"
"Beautiful crescent moon but the horn tips are slightly bent down, so after a while of wearing it the tips kind of dig into my skin. Also, the band was uneven and crooked, almost oval shaped, which made it uncomfortable to wear. I was able to carefully bend the band to my comfort. Overall really pretty ring
"
"Beautiful delicate moon ring. Delivery was took a little longer but worth it.
"
"i got the moon in silver as well as the branch middle knuckle and they‚Äôre perfect. true to size, looks exactly as advertised, and very flattering.
"
"I bought 4 of these rings. 3 in size 5 and 1 I asked the seller to send in a smaller size for my 4year old daughter. I had no idea her ring size and he sent the perfect size and she never takes it off! However the only reason I gave it 4 stars is because my 3 rings turned my finger green. There are clear care instructions in the box and what not to do's on how to get the best out of your rings, and it even comes with a small piece of jewelry cloth to polish it. I'm not sure what happened with mine because hers does not turn her finger green at all and she's worn it since the day we got them. Maybe mine were just too tight, either way I'm happy she is happy!

Update: the seller contacted me and helped me figure it all out and I've worn them everyday without green fingers since! I love them! Amazing customer service!!
"
"she loves her new rings
"
"I love my beautiful new rings! They are perfect (as always from Alaridesign <3) and came much faster than expected!  Thank you so much! :-)

"Wow! Beautiful craftsmanship and a perfect fit! I got my ring in the mail today and it is even more lovely in person. I can‚Äôt stop looking at it, so beautiful and delicate. A winning purchase!
"
"Love it! Wonderful service. I ordered a personalized ring for a friend. What I wanted was not listed, but I inquired about my design and the team was happy to accommodate! I ended up guessing the wrong ring size, but the shop worked with me and I was able to send it back and get it resized for free! Incredibly friendly and easy to work with (even though I threw more than a couple curve-balls at them.) Wonderful quality and beautiful engravings. I will definitely be buying from this shop again!
"
"Beautiful ring! I ordered for my mom who is starting a grandchildren stacking ring collection. Added a secret message from my son to her inside. It came out even more wonderful then I pictured
"
"My second ring from Emily and I‚Äôm so happy! I fell in love with her ‚Äúbeloved‚Äù design and I love it more in person!
"
"I love this ring. This shop goes above and beyond to make sure you‚Äôre completely satisfied and they do beautiful work. So cute and dainty. ‚ÄúAnd though she be but little she is fierce.‚Äù
"
"The ring is beautiful. I ordered one originally but it was a very dark amethyst color and not like the photo so I ordered another one and asked for one similar to the photo. And when I received it, it was just like the photo. And they look better on my finger with 2 so I‚Äôm keeping both. But just know if you love the photo to ask for that shade of the stone. Ex light purple compared to dark purple. If you don‚Äôt ask you may not get the color you had in mind. Shipping is quick and the quality seems great! I love my purchase
"
"So much more beautiful in real life. I generally don't buy amethyst jewelry because I tend to like neutral colors. This really bridged the difference between vibrant and earthy. I love it! The band is delicate in design but still sturdy. The gold finish is warm, exactly what I needed for my skin tone. Perfect accessories for the fall. Looks good as a stacking ring or solo.
"
"Gorgeous ring. Absolutely love it! Slightly smaller size 7 than I anticipated. Still worked out. Will probably get another ring here soon.
"
"sooo pretty!! I asked the seller for a lighter color crystal and that's what I got, love it! 
I wanted the ring to fit on my index finger but apparently I ordered too small even after a lot of measurements, not the seller's fault just keep that in mind if you know you have chubby fingers and don't buy a lot of rings online.
"
"Amazing quality! This is my second purchase from CaitlynMinimalist, but this is the first order that I‚Äôve actually seen up close. (My first order was a gift and was mailed directly to my friend.) I am blown away by how great the quality is! It took about 2 weeks for the ring to ship since it was being customized, but it was definitely worth the wait! A very simple ring, but I love it and the ‚Äúhidden message‚Äù I had added. The photo I‚Äôm uploading isn‚Äôt the best quality because I don‚Äôt have a great camera on my phone, but I still wanted to share a picture.
"
"These rings a more than I expected. They come in beautiful little boxes and each ring is solid and stunning. I am so happy. Thank you so much ‚ù§Ô∏è
"
"i am beyond in love with my purchase! can't wait to get my stacking rings!
"
"I‚Äôve ordered two custom rings from this shop and I adore them! They‚Äôre perfect, especially if you want something dainty. I got both engraved on the inside and outside, and the fonts are both so cute! (The ‚Äúardently‚Äù one I got like 6 months ago so that‚Äôs why it‚Äôs a bit scuffed, I never take it off) The packaging is amazing too!!
"
"It's impossible to capture the beauty and quality of this ring with a photo. It has some heft to it and feels like it will last forever. You can see a rainbow if you tilt it the right way. This was perfect for my promise ring and I couldn't be happier with it! It is absolutely stunning in person and I'll be buying more from this shop.
"
"the rings are stunning and fit perfectly. i got a size 9 for the middle finger and 8 for the ring. the photo doesn't do justice to you colors when it hits the light.
"
"I‚Äôm so absolutely in love with my ring. It came super fast & with a lil something that really showed I was valued as a customer. I can not say enough how happy I am!
"
"This ring has exceeded my hopes on every level. I bought this ring as a gift of love to myself, my ‚ÄúI‚Äôm in love with me‚Äù ring...and the beautiful design and divine rainbow-flash of the stone are everything I was hoping for, and more.  The shipping was faster than expected, too!
"
"so so so beautiful and fits perfectly! i will definitely order more!
"
"Love. Super cute perfect fit. Exactly what I wanted
"
"This ring is so perfect. I was worried it would not fit my finger but it fits perfectly! It is not super bulky and feels very comfortable. I hope I can buy from this shop again soon!
"
"So pretty! Delivery was fast and came with such a sweet handwritten note :)
"
"This came so quickly and looks amazing!! I'm currently loosing weight so i love that this is adjustable as my ring size keeps changing!! Love love LOVE!!!
"
"This ring is so pretty and comfortable and fits both my size 7 and size 6 finger comfortably after adjusting. It's such a pretty everyday ring.
"
"I love this ring - it‚Äôs so beautiful and simple that I can‚Äôt stop looking at it!!
"
"Very pretty and well made rings! I absolutely love mine. They‚Äôre easy to adjust and I even forget they‚Äôre on my fingers because they‚Äôre so comfortable. Highly recommend purchasing from this shop!
"
"I received my rings today (2) and they are absolutely stunning!! I have small fingers and they fit perfectly.  More than met my expectations. Thank you so much!!
"
"I love my rings!!!! Let me say that the wait is well worth it. My rings are not only as expected but when I put them on I felt a great energy from them. I made the right choice with these and you will too. I've washed my hands several times already since receiving them and no tarnishing or color changing. The owner also sends very detailed information about the order and processing time, shipping, and will message you again when it has been delivered. They definitely have a lifetime customer and will be referring them as much as possible.
"
"I absolutely love my rings! They look dainty, but are excellent quality! I will definitely be ordering from Alari Design again!
"
"These are so dainty and pretty, I love them! I also appreciate the cleaning cloth they came with and all the care info. Michael did a great job!
"
"I ordered the rose gold smaller band and the personalized one! My wedding ring and band no longer fit me as they are two sizes too big. I, unfortunately, can‚Äôt resize them because the smaller stones would eventually fall out. I bought these to hold me off until we could afford to by myself a new ring in my correct size. I love them! They are even better then I imagined them to be. Even though they are small and dainty, which is what I wanted, the rings are still firm and don‚Äôt bend. I just received them about an hour ago and I put them on immediately. They are gorgeous.
"
"Waited a few days before I left a review to ensure that they were actually the REAL gold rings. They are BEAUTIFUL!  So dainty and girly. I love not having to take my rings off to do normal activities that requires water or sweat.  Will purchase two more soon to have that cute stackable vibe. LOVE, LOVE, LOVE.
"
"This is exactly what I was looking for - dainty and small, but just perfect to make a statement. I love my new ring, and I definitely will be purchasing more in the near future!
"
"Absolutely love these rings! They‚Äôre the perfect size, and perfect additions to my every day jewelry.
"
"This is a beautiful ring. It is EXACTLY what I was hoping for. The letter 'M' 
in old English font is the perfect look and because it signifies my daughter's name, it means so much more to me. Thank you Alon for this amazing ring and for quickly replying to my questions.  I highly recommend this shop! .... and it even arrived way earlier than expected.
"
"Everything about this order was perfect and exceeded my expectations. The designer, Alon, communicated with me me throughout the process and even helped me make some adjustments and very personalized piece. 

The necklace arrived yesterday and it‚Äôs gorgeous! Exactly what I wanted. The chain  is stunning and the letters are tiny and exactly the size I wanted. The piece is so fine and just beautiful. I‚Äôm so happy! And with the express shipping it arrived in less than a week from Israel to NY.  

Thank you so much Alon! I love it!
"
"I absolutely love my ring. I'm incredibly happy with the quality, this feels like a sturdy/wearable/durable ring.
"
"Alon provided me with great customer service, was incredibly helpful & sent such a lovely little note in the package that made the experience purchasing from this small business so special! The ring fits perfectly* and is beautifully engraved with such quality, intention, and detail. 10/10 and would love to purchase from him again.
"
"Beautiful! I just love it! So cute and dainty just like I wanted! So pretty and will definitely look to this shop for more jewelry! She was also very great with communication. Told me exactly what was going to happen and when with shipping! Thank you!!
"
"Very cute ring and unique too!
"
"Very happy with this ring.  My daughter loves it.
"
"Have never got it. Would give 0 stars if I could.  I want my money back
"
"Words can‚Äôt even describe how impressed I was! At first I was skeptical ordering a ring without seeing it in person. However I‚Äôm so glad I did! Lena was amazing throughout the whole process! My boyfriend and I picked out this ring together as my engagement ring, but has not yet proposed, so waiting to officially wear it! Highly recommend this shop! They were very flexible with payments and doing custom sizing. Couldn‚Äôt have had a better experience!
"
"Love love love love love. The top photo shows the contrast in direct sunlight, and the bottom is inside. Depending on the lighting the grey will be more pronounced. (The colors seen in the bottom photo are from a stained glass window reflecting nearby!) I absolutely love this ring and am so glad we chose to order from Lena. She answered any and every question I had and the ring took only 3 days to arrive once shipped. After spending weeks looking for a salt and pepper diamond, I was thrilled to come across this listing. If you are even considering a salt and pepper diamond, do not hesitate to inquire about this beauty!
"
"So this is my second engagement ring, we got it to match my fianc√©‚Äôs wedding band since his is grey/black with black diamonds + rose gold trim. It‚Äôs so beautiful in person and people love it! 
I put a photo of the 2 ct. salt and pepper ring with rose gold alongside my original ring (not from etsy) which is a .65 center white diamond for comparison. My ring size is a 3.5. The seller was very nice and sent me a video and photo of the diamond she would use.
"
"I can‚Äôt stop staring at my new engagement ring! Honestly it‚Äôs one of the prettiest rings I‚Äôve ever seen. My fianc√© is very proud of it and I‚Äôm a very happy fianc√©e. He says his favorite part is how much I love it. Lena was amazing and patient answering all our questions about fitting it with wedding bands we had from my grandma. She even gave us a little sneak video to help with our excitement (though to be honest it was all my excitement)!  Shipping was incredibly fast! I hear nothing but compliments when people notice my ring!
"
"The rings are really beautiful and you can adjust the wire to your finger which is so handy, it‚Äôs my favorite ring I‚Äôve ever had. The seller is the nicest seller I‚Äôve ever encountered, super kind person! Here you can tell a difference between the real pearls and fake ones as pictured! The size I got is a 6 and it‚Äôs barely too big but the 5 1/2 would‚Äôve been too small for reference :-). It took about a month to get to me in California because they‚Äôre based in Idaho but it‚Äôs def worth the wait. I wanna order more ASAP.
"
"this ring is so so pretty!!! so dainty and sweet ü•∫ i got this one and the braided gold ring so i could stack them and i‚Äôm so happy! will definitely be buying from the shop again!! i also have smallish hands so these rings are so perfect haha
"
"My ring is beautiful!  It‚Äôs perfect in every way. From quality, sizing, shipping, and price I score my purchase way past a 10. I WILL be back for more and WILL be telling my friends about this vendor. The owner, Jamie, was so appreciative of my purchase and wrote a sweet and special note along with my ring. I am so pleased. You will be too!!!
"
"I am so in love with my ring!!! It is dainty but very sturdy and strong! I will definitely be buying more rings.
"
"I am in love with this ring!! I was hoping it would be an amethyst with light an dark in it an that‚Äôs exactly what I gotüíú it feels so comfortable on my finger, very light in weight an the energy feels pure. It is so perfect!
"
"I absolutely adore it! I was hoping for a nice, chunky stone and everything about it is just about perfect. I may have just proposed to myself with this ring because I cannot stop staring at it!
"
"This ring is so incredibly beautiful. I keep getting compliments on it at work (that's the only place I really go). The ring is lighter than pictured. The lighting inside my home is just very dim.
"
"Love this ring! I've been looking for an amethyst ring for a while and fell for this raw look. So glad I could get it in a large size too since I have arthritis and my fingers are almost always swollen. It's hard to find larger rings for women. Thank you!
"
"Such a lovely little shop! Great communication and I‚Äôm in love with my new rings!! Thank you xx
"
"Such lovely delicate little rings! I do wish my labradorite flashed more blue but that‚Äôs not due to anything other than the stone :) everything was packaged beautifully and Eni included a lovely note as well. I‚Äôll definitely be back for more pretty jewellery!
"
"I love my dainty ring its the perfect fit. I purchased another to stack with the gem stone ring and it looks lovely a very big thank, and yes they give me great joy.
Ahne Jewellery is sent beautifully wrapped with a 20% off next purchase which i thought was very generous.
"
"Such a beautiful minimalistic ring! I ordered this one a second time, because I lost my first one and it is also as lovely as the other one. In my package there was a personel, lovely note from Eny which made me smile as I opened it. I can absolutely recommend this shop.
"
"Just what I wanted! I bought it for my index finger and didn‚Äôt know my size so am thrilled with the adjustable feature. It is so pretty. I love it!
"
"I was having problems with the post office holding my package and i finally got it after about a month. I cried, everything they sent me, out of the goodness of their own hearts for me losing my mom, was the most important thing for me. this shop is full of caring people and they have the biggest hearts. i will always give them 5/5 10/10 and i will continue to shop here. thank you for everything ‚ù§Ô∏è
"
"Love this ring! I've worn it every day. It is well made. Very good quality compared to other similar wave rings I've seen. Love that it's adjustable, so I can switch the ring to any finger.
"
"Sooooo cute and I can wear it as a midi ring, which I love even more! Seller was super helpful when I asked him about tracking not updating and  I would purchase again! Thank you!
"
"Absolutely love these rings; exactly as pictured, and I love mixing and matching how I wear them.
"
"Delicate with beautiful sheen and so fun to stack in different combinations. My 22 yo daughter loved these!
"
"I absolutely adore my new set of rings. They are so beautifully made. This is my favourite shop on Etsy and I can't wait to order my next little indulgence! Thank you Taqqiya :)
"
"Love these rings. Dainty and beautiful!
"
"IN LOVE WITH MY NEW RING! After 3 kids in 5 years I can‚Äôt fit my weddings rings any more and decided to forego resizing and go with a simple, dainty, shiny and minimalist look that is still functional but sparkly :) also wanted to add- I am still changing diapers & work as a nurse. I absolutely LOVE this hammered gold look and I chose to engrave ‚ÄúXV ‚ù§Ô∏èNAW‚Äù Which is my wedding date anniversary and my husband‚Äôs initials. Shipped fast, looks exactly as I dreamed of & I couldn‚Äôt be happier! I love supporting Etsy and kept getting ads on my phone for rings that were 3-4x this price which I am not sure where they are made. Feel happy to know exactly where this came from! Would def purchase more from this shop!!
"
"I LOVE this ring! It‚Äôs so dainty and perfect. I do not wear jewelry often, so this really caught my eye because of the simplicity of it and meaningful personalization. I really appreciate the handwritten note that came with it. I am in awe. Thank you so so much!!
"
"Just received my ring and it was worth the wait. The packaging was very sweet & the personalization on the ring was perfect. Shipping took a little over a month & i‚Äôm still waiting on another ring. If y‚Äôall have the patience, i definitely recommend ordering from them. Thank you!
"
"This ring is delicate and beautiful! The rose gold is a pretty pink and the stamped letters are even and legible. I‚Äôve had it for a few months now and it‚Äôs held up to almost daily wear.
"
"Hello.... I just received my rings , so happy with my purchase. The original picture did not do them justice. The silver is much prettier in person, a good weight, really shiny, and the craftsmanship is perfect. Thank you so much.
"
"I love the simplicity of these three rings. Great price! So nicely polished sterling silver, and I am playing around with stacking them on one finger or mixing them around in singles, or doubling one finger, and using one as a thumb ring. Thank you for delivering it in a reasonable time. 
Take care, and Happy Holidays!!
"
"These are amazing! So comfortable on my finger, they are smooth, lightweight and beautiful! Exactly what I‚Äôve been searching for- will buy here again!
"
"Absolutely stunning! I love them so much, and thewrappedpixie was very accommodating when I had to change the size of the rings after I initially placed the order. So happy to support this jeweler!
"
"The Garnet ring gold is beautiful.  I am so pleased that I treated myself with this birthday item.  Would buy from this seller again!
"
"This is such a pretty ring! Beautifully made. Very pleased. Thank you üòä
"
"The ring is gorgeous and I love that it came with care instructions. Thank you so much. This is a birthday gift to myself and it arrived a day before my birthday. üòä
"
"As pictured. I love the hammered ring and the garnet is gorgeous. I can't wait to gift it to my mom. Thank you!
"
"Es precios√≠simo! Tal y como se muestra en las fotos. Es ideal y queda s√∫per femenino. Estoy muy feliz con la compra. Much√≠simas gracias!!
"
"Really lovely ring - better than the pic even. GREAT quality. so happy. will definitely buy from again.
"
"This ring is perfect.
I love everything about it.
Hoping it is sturdy and that the gold finish will last‚ú®üíõü§ûüèªüíõ‚ú®
"
"Love this ring! Arrived quickly and is even cuter then the photos! Will definitely purchase more from this shop.
"
"Super cute!! Took about a month to get delivered but it‚Äôs okay. My fingers are so difficult to find a good ring size because my knuckles are bigger then my fingers, so it was a tad big. But super pretty! Thank you!
"
"I love this ring! I have received so many compliments and I‚Äôve only worn it a handful of times. The only drawback was that I waited 2 months for the ring to arrive. However, the seller was extremely helpful and eager to make things right. I would definitely recommend!
"
"Absolutely in love with my ring xx
"
"Love this ring, I‚Äôve gotten so many compliments on it! I‚Äôve been wearing it almost everyday and it still seems to keep its shine and it really is quality work. It did take a little long to get here but it came quickly by Covid Standards if you think about it because I live in the US and it was shipped from another country. I would continue buying from this seller they have great quality work!!
"
"Okay, I love this ring SO MUCH. Its cute online/in photos but it‚Äôs even better in person. So dainty and beautifully made. I genuinely want to buy more and stack them and that‚Äôs not generally an inclination of mine. My fingers are tiny and I feel like most rings overwhelm them (sounds weird, but whatever) and this just makes me feel good. Highly recommend!
"
"I love this ring. I was wanting something small and this is so dainty. I should have ordered it at least half a size bigger than I normally wear because it does run a little smaller. I ordered this ring Oct 9th and received it on Oct 15th, so it was shipped fast.
"
"I love this ring. Super dainty but still feels sturdy enough that I don‚Äôt worry about it bending out of shape. Stone color is very deep. I love the hammered look of the band; it adds dimension and character without making it seem less nice of a ring. The fit was perfect, too. I was looking for something that I could wear that with a fun, simple stack that was still elegant enough to go on a hand with my engagement and wedding rings. And we have a winner
"
"Very cute. The ring looks just as advertised. Production before shipping took 7 days, but shipping was fast and actually arrived a day early! This ring is perfect for a dainty mother‚Äôs ring with my sons birthstone.
"
"Wow wow wow wow wow. 
This ring is so incredibly gorgeous! I can't say enough awesome things about it. 
Sparkles like real diamonds for a fraction of the cost-human and environmental, plus you're supporting a small business. Also, it's so dainty and cute-perfect for stacking with my wedding band. :)
"
"love this dainty yet elegant and beautiful ring! the band looked really 
thin at first but rest assured, this ring is sturdy and is so far withholding my months of  rough handling! I like bling but something not too flashy and this was the perfect compromise. will definitely consider ordering again when I want to treat myself!
"
"This ring is so beautiful and elegant! It‚Äôs perfect with my engagement ring and I can‚Äôt wait to wear it everyday :)
"
"Omg, at last a ring that looks great with my engagement ring! Not going to lie, this sweet little piece is absolutely perfect. So grateful!
"
"I ordered this ring as a wedding ring - I have small and dainty hands so the typical wider wedding bands don't flatter my finger. This ring was dispatched and arrived quickly, despite coming from Seoul. It was dispatched on the Friday from South Korea and arrive in the UK on the Wednesday - all the way up in the highlands of Scotland no less! I have a marquis shaped engagement ring and it fits perfectly around the engagement ring. It is a very delicate ring and therefore quite thin, so bear that in mind before ordering. It is very beautiful and I can't wait to wear it!
"
"I‚Äôm absolutely stunned at the dainty beauty of these minimalist chevron rings!! Thank you so much for putting the love and care into each piece for my best friend and I!
"
"I love everything about this ring, the quality is awesome and it fits just right! I will definitely be ordering from here again!
"
"Beautiful, dainty ring! I bought it as a midi ring and absolutely love it. Thank you!
"
"This is sooooo very delicate and pretty, just what I wanted if not even better! Thank you :)
"
"packed so lovely the ring is exactly what i was wanting and is perfect!! Highly recommend.
"
"Well, where should I start...The gorgeous ring that I purchased arrived really quickly after being wonderfully homemade and came packaged like this. Thank you ever so much! I‚Äôll definitely be back :)
"
"Love it! Lightweight and adjustable
"
"Love love love this piece! Big thanks to Kristina for everything she did to get my purchase to me.  My address got messed up online and she went above and beyond, spending two hours on hold calling the packaging center to make sure my order got to me and updating me frequently, such a pleasure to work with.  And the ring is beautiful!  Dainty and really pretty detailing.  would 100% recommend!
"
"Kristen was so great at communicating with me back and forth with questions I had about the ring. She even customized the width of the band at my request. It shipped quick! Its such a dainty ring but extremely sturdy. I was a bit apprehensive about this purchase but I am more than thrilled with this ring! I wear size 7 for reference.
"
"I love this ring! It‚Äôs exactly as pictured and so dainty and cute! I haven‚Äôt taken it off since I‚Äôve received it, and have so many people compliment it!
"
"When I saw this ring, I had to have it! It is simple yet beautiful. The only negative is that I ordered it a 1/2 size too big, so the shaping in the ring is bending a little. Overall though, I think this makes an excellent gift for someone or for yourself!
--
Update: When I posted this original review, the owner of the shop reached out to me and was so incredibly sweet. She was able to resize my ring, and it is just beautiful. What a lovely ring and shop!
"
"I ordered this ring on Sept 19, 2020 and finally received it on October 9, 2020.  I expected for it to take a long time to ship so I was not concerned about the ship time.  It seems like things are taking longer than usual in the mail.  When I ordered this ring, I expected it to be a cheap ring because of how affordable it was, but I thought it looked cute so I ordered it.  

I am blown away by the quality of this ring.  It is absolutely beautiful and dainty and so much better than I expected.  I rarely take the time to do reviews, but I like this ring so much that I had to.  I cannot wait to wear this ring on a regular basis and is a great addition to my jewelry box.
"
"Pictures don't do this beautiful ring justice! I loved it so much I bought another ring from your shop last week! Will be buying all my rings from here! <3
"
"gorgeous ring!! i got one for a secret santa but then i had to go back & by another one for myself oops hahaha. i wear it almost every day and i‚Äôm so in love with it! definitely will be buying from this shop again in the future!! <3 :)
"
"LOVE this ring. Please ignore my fat fingers and dry hands. The jewelry is so dainty and pretty. Also feels durable. Thank you Constant Ruckus!
"
"My Christmas present to myself this year. First-the packaging is so adorable, I kept the box! I do love my ring, dainty enough but still makes a statement. The lettering is amazing; so detailed. For anyone who needs an idea of the space, mine is 9 characters with one space. The only thing I would improve is the shipping time, though I attribute that to this year‚Äôs unusual circumstances!
"
"I am in absolute love with my purchase! From the quick delivery to the amazing packaging and the perfect little dainty ring. It‚Äôs all so beautiful and the seller is just so nice and quick to respond! I will definitely be buying more from this shop!! I just can‚Äôt get over how giddy I am!!
"
"I stacked this ring along with another Etsy made ring and I'm so happy with it. I wear it every day and it feels so light
"
"The ring is BEAUTIFUL!! The packaging was so precious! And I honestly cannot believe how fast I received this ring! Thank you so so much!!
"
"I bought this ring 3 years ago in a size 10 I loved it since then I have lost weight I have repurchased it in a size 7 the quality is still amazing and it arrived quicker than I expected I love this company thank you so much
"
"Beautiful ring, very realistic! It is quite thin so it is perfect for stacking. I ordered wrong size and Beth quickly resized it for me, so I have a beautiful set now :) Thanks a lot!!
"
"Amazing! I adore this ring, and the other similar one I bought from this store. They look exactly like pictured, like tips of a willow branch frozen in tarnished silver. I have not taken them off since I've received them (over a month ago). I shower with them, they have not changed. Absolutely fantastic. I will certainly buy more jewelry from this store. Thank you!!!
"
"I have a cat named Willow who is very very dear to me and I wanted a piece of jewellery to wear that symbolised how much I treasure her, so when I found this gorgeous willow branch ring I fell in love. It‚Äôs a truly dainty piece that I adore and never take off. Thank you! üêà‚Äç‚¨õüåø
"
"love this lil thing!
"
"Great customer service. Unfortunately the ring I ordered originally wasn't available, so I went with the rose gold instead. I received the ring and it didn't fit the intended finger. I sent a message to the shop and Mary helped me out right away. I ended up getting the silver ring in a size up and only had to pay the cost of shipping.
"
"Loooove this ring.
"
 
"I wish I would have bought more. This bracelet is SO LUX I want all my girls to have one now. It‚Äôs the perfect size not too dainty not too thick the chain and clasp feel so well made. Came in a gift box with ribbon and lovely card with tissue. It‚Äôs my favorite Etsy purchase so far!!!! Thank you!!
"
"I love this ring !! Seller is very nice to work with, and my ring fits perfectly !!
"
"I lobe this pinky ring. It‚Äôs adorable!
"
"This ring it so, so beautiful. I love everything about it. I‚Äôm so glad I found you on ETSY.
"
"Just got the ring and I LOVE it üòç
"
"I absolutely adore this ring and the seller was very helpful in getting it to me in time before an overseas trip! Would purchase more from this store in the future :)
"
"La bague est magnifique! 
J'ai eu peur de ne pas la recevoir, c'√©tait la premi√®re fois que je commandait un item d'aussi loin üòÅ
Mais, fausse inqui√©tude ! 
Elle est l√†, √† mon doigt, et n'est pas pr√™te de me quitter!
"
"It just got here. I love it!
"
"Such a pretty ring and fits like a dream. The packaging it came in was also lovely. Put a smile on my face! A lot of love has went in to it all! Big thanks :)
"
"This is a beautiful and very special ring! I am super happy with both purchases. They only arrived today after getting stuck in pandemic international shipping crazy, but not the sellers fault and definitely worth waiting for! Thank you üòä
"
"I love my new ring! It fits perfectly and is so pretty! I received it within a week, (with a weekend in between!) And it was well packaged with lovely extra touches, thank you!
"
"I bought this ring as a gift for my sister, and am so pleased I purchased from Buttonsy! The ring is well made - polished well, and lighter than I'd expected. I've never purchased resin jewelry before so I wasn't sure what to expect. The artist is lovely to work with as well. Shipping from the UK to MD took about 3 weeks standard shipping.
"
"I love this ring, and shipping was fast!! I do wish the ring was a little bigger... I like big, chunky rings.
"
"Perfect fit and I have very fat fingers. Vintage metal look that's perfect for an every day outfit or pair it with other jewelry for a special event. I'd include a photo but no one wants to see my sausage hands.

"This ring is gorgeous and fits perfectly! It's true to size and I love that the shop carries half sizes. The artist gently bent the triple moon around the band so it won't catch on things as much. It feels sturdy and arrived very quickly. I'm thrilled-thank you!
"
"Beautiful ring. I love the intricate detail. It‚Äôs become a daily staple for me. Thank you so much!
"
"This is the cutest ring ever I love it. Shipping did not take too long but I was also anxious to get it. Will be purchasing more. Also the package it came with was adorable
"
"I absolutely adore this ring! It‚Äôs very nice quality and beautiful. I have received so many compliments on it!
"
"love love love!
"
"I'm enjoying every purchase from this seller. My ring fits perfectly.
"
"Love it! Dainty & shiny! I forget I‚Äôm even wearing my wedding band which I love because I used to wear my diamond eternity wedding band & it was really bulky
"
"1.2 mm is the perfect size to wear alone or paired with my engagement ring. Very happy wish I would have done this sooner!
"
"Gorgeous, and so polished and shiny. I love the 1.2mm thickness. It is not flimsy like some rings I‚Äôve seen under 1mm. Sturdy and perfect! Would definitely buy again
"
"I absolutely love my ring! It arrived so quickly and is even more dainty in person. I‚Äôm going to order it in yellow gold now. Thank u!
"
"Its absolutely beautiful. They responded very quickly to my message and helped me measure my finger for the correct ring size. I was super nervous to get a ring that was too small or too big. But i was pleasantly surprised it fit perfectly! Even if i didn't they reassured me  i could exchange it. It looks just like the pictures very elegant
"
"My black onyx ring arrived and its so beautiful. I got the rose gold to be slightly less harsh and it looks so subtle on my hands. I love this jewellery and I‚Äôm already looking at my next purchase.
"
"The ring definitely met my expectations, this is something I saved in my cart for a long time. I‚Äôm glad I finally made the purchase. I wear it everyday and get many compliments.
"
"It‚Äôs more than what i expected ! i love the ring I‚Äôve gotten so many compliments . Definitely buying from the shop again !
"
"Such a beautiful ring! I ordered the wrong size but Giorgia very kindly resized it for me and now it‚Äôs perfect!
"
"Lovely ring, great purchase. The seller was great as I messaged to change the size of the ring with no problem. Beautiful packaging.
"
"Such a cute ring. I love it!
"
"beautiful thin band I love it
"
"My girlfriend loves the ring! Has barely taken it off since we got it. 
Absolute GOAT with amazing customer service, kept us in the loop constantly during the shipping process and even took the time to change the ring size when it was a tad bit big.
Amazing Service and Product. 11/10.
"
"This ring is just beautiful, dainty and delicate!  Just as pictured and described.  Love it!
"
"Looks great and so far no complaints. I wanted something that matched my other one and I think they look nice together. Thank you!
"
"The ring is gorgeous, I‚Äôve had it for about two months now. I ordered it in rose gold and when I received it, it was only half covered and the other half was silver. By now the ring is completely silver. It also took a little over a week to finally ship. The stones are beautiful, however.
"
"I am so happy with how these turned out! My raindrop baby will always be with me now. Thank you!
"
"It turned out so perfect! I couldn‚Äôt wait to give it to my mom! It fits perfectly and the lettering is beautiful! So happy I found this!
"
"I love my rings! They took a while to come but I love them so much! Quality is AMAZING! I am impressed
"
"Omg! Perfection! I ordered the spacer ring elsewhere but it goes perfectly with the two name rings I ordered! Love it thank you so much! Came just in time for a Christmas gift :)
"
"Absolutely love my ring!  I have gotten so many compliments on it. So so happy. And Paige also sent a sweet note with my package which was gift wrapped for free. I will def buy from her shop again. Shipping was faster than I expected. Just all around fantastic!!
"
"I ordered this ring in the silver setting as a gift for my 40th wedding anniversary.  This ring is absolutely gorgeous!  Looks better in person than it does in the picture and it is a perfect fit!  LOVE IT!
"
"I really enjoyed working with Paige. She was great and made sure I was happy with my ring! My initial ring was too large, so she customized a smaller size for me. The ring itself is very pretty and has a beautiful faceted ruby stone inside. I wholeheartedly recommend purchasing from Without Remorse and I love that a portion of the sale goes to help aid lion conservations! Thank you again!
"
"The ring is beautiful and as described.  It shipped quickly.  I asked a few questions before I purchased the ring and they were answered quickly.  Very happy with the experience.
"
"I purchased this ring in celebration of the birth of my son. Fits perfect and is beautiful. I waited to review to see if it changed the color of my skin at all. Nope no color change and it's been 2 weeks. Very happy with this product.
"
"Its a beautiful ring and I love the beaded design that encompassed the circumference!  It shipped fast and was exactly as pictured.
"
"The ring is beautiful and dainty! Once I received my original purchase, I realized I had ordered the wrong size, and the seller accommodated my return, no problem. Very happy!
"
"My favüíï
"
"Hawkhouse jewelry is truly magical! 
Jessica made a custom ring for me to give as a gift.
She was friendly and a delight to work with. she really went above and beyond. The finished product is lovely. 
She let me know custom jewelry ships in 2 weeks but the ring arrived much sooner than estimated. Thank you again! I will be ordering something special for myself but I am having trouble choosing between all of your beautiful creations!
"
"I love my ring so much! It's better in person than the photos, and the photos are so lovely. Not only did it arrive quickly, but there was an issue with my ring and Jessica was amazing at replacing and shipping out the new one. 
 
I will be purchasing again, soon!

"I am so in love with my beautiful ring! I will definitely be ordering another one! 10/10
"
"This is actually 4.5 stars.
I just received my little ring. I like it. 
HOwever, I'm a little disappointed that it doesn't show much green but mostly black. The beautiful green color is what draws me in. Other than that, it's very well made and cute!
"
"Love it! So delicate and pretty. It is exactly as shown and falls the same as it does on the model. Very lovely!
"
"Just received my order in the mail today! It is beautiful! The packaging was adorable and the necklace itself is lovely and delicate. It is especially shiny in the sunlight. Very good quality, I am pleased!
"
"Loving it!!! A beautiful necklace.
"
"Beautiful. Everything I hoped for! It is a little thin, but it looks gorgeous
"
"Dainty and beautiful! Most of the similar rings I've seen are much thicker than this, so I love how feminine this one is. I think the rose gold flecks look slightly less pink in real life than they do in the picture, but it's still a gorgeous ring.
"
"What a delicate, lovely little ring!  It is so comfortable to wear, so thin I barely even notice that it's there, but then the sparkle catches my eye.  Thank you so much!   :)
"
"My ring is so beautiful! It fits perfectly and is stunning. It's so unique!!
"
"Absolutely perfect!! It's so cute! The packaging was even better!! Great work!!
"
"I am beyond in love with my ring. I lost my dog last month and wanted to keep him close. This ring is perfect. Beautiful and an amazing reminder of my Chico. The owner helped me with sizing because I was WAY off! She was so so helpful and I would absolutely recommend this shop and ring to any and all! Thank you so much for giving me life back in my dog!
"
"not the greatest photo,  but i literally cried when i got it. it's true to size and fits perfectly. this ring means the world to me. simple and perfect
"
"I loveeeee my ring! It turned out gorgeous, it‚Äôs exactly what I wanted. Pictures don‚Äôt do it justice. Thank you so much!
"
"It was amazing. I lost my dog of 14 years and I just wanted something to keep with me and now I feel like he is with me always. Looking down at my hand I know he's watching over me.  Yes ofcourse materialistic things don't matter when someone you loose is gone, they are forever in your heart, but I just feel that he's with me while I wear and see his name and call it to say I love you. üêæ Thank you for this. Keep well!
"
"Love the simplicity of this ring. The ring does have a little bit of weight so it definitely not delicate. I knew that ordering this ring, it might fit slightly different. So i had to get it resized just a tad bigger. All in all, it is a good quality ring.
"
"Well made ring. Comfortable to wear, put on, and remove. Love the hammered look. Plus it was fun watching it oxidize the first day till it got the antique look I was going for. Will definitely be back when I finish figuring out all my sizes.
"
"I love these rings. Not sure if they will tarnish but if they do I will just polish.  I will be ordering more.  I ordered 2 but you can easily wear 4 together. Very well made, not to thin.
"
"Perfect piece of jewelry. Fits great and very comfortable on.  Made very well. Glad I found this jeweler.
"
"Love this ring, I'm wearing a piece of art on my finger!
"
"So cute! Created three little scenery sets for two friends and I to share.
"
"These rings are beautifully made and I've had so many lovely compliments on them (I now have the whole set!), i just wish they came in different sizes, they are quite large so it really limits where I can wear them. But thank you, i still love them!
"
"I love my new rings it's just beautiful.
"
"Love, love, love this ring!! And thank you so much for the necklace as well. It means more than you think!  My 3 month old niece passed away about 6 months ago and her name was Ellie.  Her room was decorated in elephants and since she's been gone, the whole family has stuck with the elephant theme. We started a charity in her name and even used an elephant for the logo. I was excited to find a dainty, gold ring but getting the necklace too was so amazing! I love that it's shorter so it's always visible and also it'll be so great for layering. Thank you again!
"
"I love this ring and how it comes with two other complimentary rings. The only negative that I can think of is how the two other rings were turning sort of gray üòû. I like using the extra rings as thumb rings. But enough about the extras. I love the elephant ring itself, how shiny it stays, and how it doesn't turn gray. The ring is fantastic! ü•∞!
"
"Absolutely love!
"
"I love this ring so much! It is a really nice size, it's not too big but not too small and fits me just right! I am really surprised that it fits as well as it does and it looks so pretty and shiny! This ring is perfect, thank you also for the petite necklace I received as a gift in the package! I am going to be paying it forward as a gift to someone else! Thank you! :)
"
"A gorgeous ring and a professional seller! Shipping the first time around was so quick, but I mismeasured my finger and ordered a size too big; Laurie was fast and kind in her response and even quicker to ship the second time! The ring is a perfect fit now, a standout piece (for a ring so small in presentation!), and the stone is absolutely flawless. It's my new favorite accessory, and this is my new favorite Etsy shop. Thank you Laurie!
"
"I absolute LOVED this ring! I received it very quickly and as soon as I put it on, my heart felt lighter and I felt really connected to it. I took it off yesterday morning as I had to bathe my baby and poof, it disappeared... I am heartbroken and cannot wait to buy another one!!!
"
"I have not taken this ring off since it arrived. I‚Äôm obsessed with my rings and this one has quickly become my favourite. Will definitely be ordering again! Thank you!! üíñ
"
"I got the hammered band and I love it so much. The ring is absolutely beautiful and it was shipped super fast!!
"
"absolutely incredible service! I've ordered 2 of these rings at different points and both times the seller has been absolutely incredible. I adored these rings so much that I had to get another when mine became too small. 100% worth buying, they're incredible quality and so beautiful
"
"This ring is absolutely beautiful! The quality is amazing! It's better than I expected! The size, shipping, experience, everything.. has been so great! Thank you so much!
"
"It is beautiful! Perfect detail of the sunflower. The ring looks exactly like the picture. I am very happy!
"
"I got the 3 color one, and I absolutely LOVE it!!! It fits perfectly, it‚Äôs not too bulky for my little hands. Great craftsmanship, it feels super durable so I‚Äôm not paranoid about damaging it in everyday life. Thank you so much!!
"
"Gorgeous love it
"
"So pleased with my sons spinner ring,arrived quickly, fitted nicely, description says women‚Äôs,but liked the design,would recommend, men/ women
Thankyou very much
Stay safe
Happy customer Lisa üòÄ
"
"exactly what I was looking!
"
"I love this ring!  I bought it large enough to wear on my thumb while I video making my jewelry.  Thank you for the beautiful design!!!
"
"So my ring arrived in the wrong colour than what I either ordered or thought I ordered, I am not un happy about this though! It's stunning! I cannot get over the price and quality, it's cute and dainty and will actually be my wedding band. I'm over the moon, the box it came in was stunning and nicer than my engagement ring at more than quadruple the cost so thank so much. It made me feel super special. I'm really, really pleased.
"
"Beautiful band! I got this because I wanted a third band for my wedding ring and I wanted it to be thin and with a few diamonds to frame my engagement ring.
"
"I absolutely adore my ring! I was searching for a slim, affordable wedding band as I‚Äôve got quite short fingers and this sits beautifully with my engagement ring. It looks much more expensive than it was, I couldn‚Äôt be happier. It also arrived really quickly considering I ordered it just before Xmas.
"
"Absolutely gorgeous! My order came quite quickly. THE PACKAGING is STUNNING. It made me feel so boujee and for such affordable jewellery I couldn‚Äôt believe how gorgeous it was. The rings are absolutely stunning too - dainty, sparkling, and great quality. I‚Äôll absolutely be buying again from Norm!
"
"Absolutely love this ring, it is really great quality! The spinner works perfectly and the ring itself stays on my finger really well (I was worried I‚Äôd order way too big since I‚Äôve never ordered rings before). However, I mostly want to just say thank you SO MUCH for helping me out when the first ring shipped got lost on its way over! The first ring shipped to me somehow got lost through the mail and never arrived, but the seller was so sweet and helpful. They were kind enough to send me a new one which just came today. If I could give more than 5 stars on seller/customer service, I absolutely would. Thank you so much!
"
"Perfect!
Another great piece from Black Feather. 
Packaging, superb and the ring, just right for me and my fidgeting, the links in the centre of the ring rotate. 
Think I will have to look at the necklaces next. 
Terrific range.
"
"Beautiful piece of artwork. It also arrived well packed. Love the quality and how the links spin freely, it‚Äôs everything and more as advertised on their website. So shiny too! Thank you for my spinner rings‚ù§Ô∏è
"
"Super service and excellent communication, I had to get the size changed and the seller was more than helpful. My daughter loves the ring and couldn‚Äôt be happier it‚Äôs just beautiful. Thank you üòä
"
"Fastest shipping I‚Äôve had in months! Ring was just as pictured, great quality! Seller even threw in a cute freebie. Will definitely buy again in future. Thank you!!
"
"The ring is so pretty! I can‚Äôt wait to give it to my boyfriend. It seems really high quality and the shipping was so fast!
"
"Once again, what a fine ring from giliarto! I love the opal inlay! It goes really nice with the other ring I bought from them. The quality is top notch and I would recommend to anyone looking to buy a nice ring for either themselves or for a lover.
"
"It is so smooth. It slides on super easy and is just all around just as pretty as the picture! Also shipping was incredibly fast
"
"I am absolutely in LOVE with this beautiful dainty little ring. It is so gorgeous, so well made, the 10k gold is absolutely stunning. I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôll ever take it off. I cannot wait to buy more rings from this shop! Thank you very much, after waiting a year to purchase this one I certainly won‚Äôt wait as long to purchase the next! :)
"
"I finally got the rings today after 2 and a half months (to Japan)
I fell in love with 2 pairs of rings on Etsy, and decided to order them for my own birthday during this difficult time. 
They are absolutely gorgeous, turned out a little bit too big for me (I checked the US size online but maybe my fingers got a little skinnier?!) but I love them so much!
Very good products and helpful service with my questions before purchasing. I will definitely order more in the future :)
"
"This ring is even better in person! Far exceeded my expectations and it arrived sooner than the estimated. I am very happy with my purchase and will be back soon for more! -10K Gold Sunshine Ring
"
"Beautiful ring. I‚Äôve had my eye on this one for sometime now. The other reviews and pictures left were really helpful in making my purchase. I ordered a size 6 because of the half size options. I really needed a 5.75 but the 6 isn‚Äôt too loose. Love it!
"
"I bought this as a Christmas gift for myself and I‚Äôm so glad I did - I could not be happier. This ring is dainty and strong and just beautifully well-made. This was my first purchase from this shop, but won‚Äôt be my last! Shipping took a few weeks since I don‚Äôt live in Canada, but it arrived more quickly than expected. Thank you for my ring; I just love it.
"
"Amazing! So beautiful. Its been 2 months and the ring has not left any green mark on my girlfriends Finger.
"
"This ring is absolutely gorgeous! It looks perfectly delicate yet feels strong and sturdy. I bought this to wear as my everyday wedding band and I‚Äôm in love. Thank you for such a thoughtful product!
"
"The most beautiful ring! The band is dainty and thin, I can hardly feel it when it‚Äôs on which I love. I was worried about sizing since I‚Äôve got such small hands, but the size 5 was perfect for me. Could not recommend more.
"
"This was an impulse, ""pick me up"" purchase on a really horrible day and week. 

I am so thrilled with this item. It is absolutely gorgeous. I appreciated that the seller makes these in a variety of in between ring sizes so it fits perfectly! The engraved details are as described and beautiful. I am not much of a jewelry person but have been wearing this ring nearly every day now!
"
"Oh my goodness! What a gorgeous ring! I‚Äôm so happy with this, I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if I ordered another one. It‚Äôs so pretty and beautifully made. Took a little while to get here but it was being made from scratch and I am in England, so I can happily forgive that. Definitely worth the wait. Recommend to others most definitely.
"
"I really love this ring! super unique and fits me to a t. love the inscription. shipping took a bit but well worth the wait. also wish it was shipped in a box. could have been smashed.
"
"I love this ring. I love that the flowers cover the entire outside, so if the ring swivels around, as rings do, there will always be flowers showing. I love the engraving. The sizing is as expected. If you don‚Äôt know your size, definitely get a sizer. The wait for how personalized, is well worth it for the final product. I‚Äôd definitely contact the owner prior to ordering if time was a concern, just to be sure things could be delivered in the time needed. Beautiful pieces and I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôll b back to try
"
 
 
"I just received my stack rings & they are so unique & beautiful. Don‚Äôt think I‚Äôll ever take them off. Will definitely be ordering from this company again!!!  The rings were delivered on time. The seller was very responsive with answers to my questions
"
"Such a beautiful stacking ring and exactly as pictured. My husband bought it for me to go with my engagement diamond, as my wedding band can sometimes feel a bit flashy to wear with the diamond day-to-day. We got this for me to wear on the other days and it compliments it perfectly! Thank you so much! ‚ú®
"
"I live in Calif. arrived in a few days, coming from Turkey that‚Äôs fast!  I share the sentiment of many of the reviews, it‚Äôs an absolute stunning piece and appears very high end. I love the stones and silver with bronze, gives the ring a unique very cool aesthetic. Initially thought this ring runs small, I purchased a 6 to wear on my forefinger however I believe my forefinger is now a 6 1/2  üòÑ so it fits perfectly on my ring finger.
"
"OMG!  I LOVE my ring!   It's BEAUTIFUL!  Took a little while to get here but it was well worth it!!! :)
"
"Wow this ring is so beautiful, I love this ring so glad I ordered it I will be ordering another. Super fast shipping and the ring is beautifully made. I was so pleased when I open my package and saw the ring, it really is beautiful.
"
"This ring is more beautiful in person than it can ever be in the photograph. The seller is amazing and I had my ring within three days all the way from Turkey. communicated the entire time and I am beyond happy.
"
"THESE ARE THE COOLEST!!!!!! Omfg I am never going to take them off! The font is amazing, the quality is grade A, everything about them makes me sooooo happy !! Thank you thank you thank you
"
"I had some custom ones made for my best friends and they turned out so well! The lettering is very crisp.
"
"awesome work ... had to pay more shipping in switzerland - never had to for jewellery but i'm super happy anyway!!!
"
"The ring looks great gold may rub off just a bit around the edge of the letters it couple be my eyes.  I had it for 2 day as noticed the silver around the sides not pronounced again could be my eyes.  but it‚Äôs beautiful still and I will get 2 more eventually for my siblings.
"
"I am blown away with how pretty and dainty this ring is.  From the photo I thought the flowers were white but they are silver which is so much better.  After looking at the photo again I can see now that they were silver.  I absolutely love this ring and it fits any of my middle 3 fingers because of how it is made.  I will cherish this sweet ring and am so happy with my purchase.
"
"I really love this ring! It‚Äôs light and delicate, in a good way! I wanted a two-tone ring and this has silver flowers with two thin gold bands as trim. The spaces between the flowers are great too because they give the ring a very light and summery vibe. Unique and lovely.
"
"Wonderful ring! It is just as pictured, a dream, delicate and amazing. I wish it was just a few mm bigger. Word of advice: measure well your finger before you order. It was shipped very fast from the time departure was announced. I was surprised that the box it was shipped in ( a box of about 4x9 inches) was so strong and suffered no damage in transport. Danke schon! And yes, I will order again.
"
"Such a beautiful ring. I love it. Well worth the wait.
"
"The service from this seller was phenomenal. I was very skeptical as this is the second time I have purchased from etsy. The first purchase I made was terrible. The shipping took over a month for a single overpriced ring to ship to me. However, the rings I received from this shop were absolutely amazing. The rings were packed twice for safety and came in their own little boxes. The shipping was speedy quick. The rose gold finish is beautiful and the inscription I asked for came out the way I had wanted it. I will definitely be buying from this shop again.
"
"Every beautiful ring! I love it, just gotta go up a size. Fat fingers...
"
"absolutely perfect, I love it so much!! thank you! would highly recommend and will definitely be purchasing from them again in the future ‚ò∫Ô∏è
"
"These rings are beautiful! The seller has amazing customer service as well. The shipping took 3 weeks, but that was no fault of the seller, USPS just takes forever lately. The only issue I have is that the rings are NOT the size I ordered. I ordered an 8 and they are a 7. Now I can't wear them on the finger I initially wanted, so I'm a little bummed about that. Everything except for real solid gold turns me green, so I'll follow the care instructions to a T and update my review if they tarnish and turn me green.
"
"This ring is so beautiful! Pictures do not do it justice. I was so pleased when I opened the box! I absolutely love it!
"
"Super fast delivery. I LOVE this ring! Its very comfy and looks fabulous!  Happy to show off my love for kayaking.  All the ladies in my yak groups are gonna want one.  I love the matching bracelet too! Havent splurged on it yet though.
"
"It‚Äôs absolutely beautiful! I love it, thank you so much!!!!
"
"I love my ring almost as much as I love kayaking!!
"
"I can't say enough good things about Christina. I was a knucklehead and ordered a size to small - please make sure you measure yourself correctly - and let her know. She asked for my size and to send it back to get adjusted. I did so and it got stuck in a Greek post office. She took it upon herself to send me the correct size and it's literally my favorite piece of jewelry. It fits perfect and I'm totally in love. She's amazing and although her product takes some time to arrive (mind you - I like in LA and it's coming from Greece so duh) it's totally worth it. I have a metal allergy and this silver ring doesn't irritate my skin and EVERYONE asks about it. You're in good hands!!!
"
"Pure love for Christina! Arrived in just under a week, beautifully made including a handwritten note. I suggest ordering a size bigger than you normally wear. I've been wearing it every day since! Thank you Christina!
"
"This ring is absolutely perfect! I ordered it as my engagement/wedding ring, so I had a lot of questions and a bit of anxiety about it. Christina was incredibly patient and maintained excellent communication with me. I ordered 7mm wide, as I knew the 10mm wide ring might be too much ring for me. I am completely thrilled and happy with the outcome! Thank you sooo much!!!
"
"This is a stunning addition to my rings!! I love the shine and the quality is amazing. Thank you so much all the way from California!!
"
"This ring is my second one, and I love it.
It turned out that with my first ring, I'd selected the wrong size, which took me a while to realise because I hadn't worn a ring before, and it still felt comfortable.
This one is also very comfortable and doesn't slide off as easily.
It also came a day earlier than expected, with a lovely handwritten note thanking me for my order and hoping that my new ring is a better fit, and a charm saying ""Hand Made With Love"".
"
"This ring is absolutely incredible! I was looking for a black band Ace ring but I also wanted something to represent being transgender. This ring fit that idea more perfectly than anything I could have asked for. It‚Äôs sturdy, comfortable, and the shipping was SO fast. Thank you so much, Beverly! Your work is amazing!
"
"I LOVE LOVE LOVE THIS!!
Its absolutely beautiful and perfect! Very sturdy glossy and just made wonderfully. And just subtle enough for my judgmental family!
Thank you so much I will be buying again for sure.
"
"I've just received the ring today. I didn't even expect it so soon and it is gorgeous (exactly what I wanted). I'm very happy.

Thanks a lot for the french note, that's very kind. And the little box for the ring is very nice!

The size is perfect (contrary to some other rings - ordered elsewhere - that were far too big).
"
"Absolutely gorgeous! Been eyeing this ring for a long time and finally bought it! So happy I did ‚ù§Ô∏è
"
"I am absolutely obsessed with my new ring!! Would recommend a million times!
"
"I am so happy with my rings!! They are gorgeous and everything I wanted!! Love this shop and will purchase again
"
"I love these rings!! So pretty and dainty. Exactly what I was looking for!!
"
"This ring is absolutely stunning!  I purchased the Tiger‚Äôs eye stone.  I loved it in the picture, but the picture does it no justice.  It is so much prettier in real life.  The band is incredibly smooth on the inside, so makes it very comfortable to wear. I will definitely be making additional purchases!
"
"Gorgeous! I love it!! I ordered my regular size 4.5 but it fits too tight due to the width of the band. Not the sellers fault, I forgot to size up for a wide band.
 I will have it tapped out larger at the Jewelry store because I love it. It‚Äôs beautiful quality
"
"I love it! I wish I knew my ring sizes better, because I wanted this as a pinky ring but it‚Äôs too big. But it fits just fine on a few other fingers! 10/10
"
"I absolutely love it. My husband died 4 months ago and I bought it to replace my engagement and wedding rings. It‚Äôs perfect.
"
"i love this ring, it‚Äôs so beautiful and aesthetically matched with my outfits. Amazing replies and help:)
"
"The Nike Swoosh ring is better than I imagined! Good quality and true sizing. Jamie was excellent to talk to. I will not hesitate to order from again.
"
"I love my ring! I ordered the wrong size but the seller was very friendly and allowed me to exchange it for the right size. Hope to buy another ring from here soon!
"
"the communication was perfect and i love the ring that i got, really great quality
"
"I've tried many times to upload a photo from my computer, but it just won't cooperate. It is my computer. But this ring is very special to me, and it also looks just as beautiful as in the photograph. It is genuinely silver as well. I really appreciate Shree's craftsmanship and promptness. This came at the time I needed it, and it is important to me.
"
"This ring is beautiful. It is perfect for a thumb ring. The spinners are great. I love this ring and this store, I'll be back for more.
"
"I absolutely love this ring.  It is very well made and looks beautiful on my hand.  The silver shines beautifully and I have had many compliments on it.  I will definitely be buying from this shop again.
I did receive this package in a timely manner and it was very well packaged .
"
"Lom√© my ring! The only thing is it was a bit small for my thumb, which is what I wanted. But I made it work and use it on my ring finger. I would definitely buy other items from here ‚ù§Ô∏è
"
"Stop looking and hit add to cart, this ring is literally perfect. I was planning to wait until our wedding to give this to my fianc√© but I loved it so much I showed him the same day it was delivered. 

Thank you Matt, for the personalized note, the free silicone bands, the beautiful hand crafted box, and the RING itself. You are incredibly talented.

"This ring is absolutely beautiful. We bought an 8 in the 6mm size. Sizing was perfect and it shipped fast. Quality craftsmanship, this person really knows what he‚Äôs doing. Even sent us tips to keep the ring clean. If something ever happens to it we‚Äôll be coming back. Thank you!
"
"My partner absolutely adores his ring. He is so in love with it. Beautiful quality. Arrived quickly. Love the silicone rings that came with it. The ring box is gorgeous as well. Thank you!
"
"Beautiful ring and the best service ever! DEFINITELY worth your money. Marty exchanged my ring for me when I made a sizing mistake (oopsies) and he was very kind and professional through the returning process! Me and my fianc√© are extremely appreciative and can‚Äôt wait to work with him in the future!
"
"Been wearing this ring for weeks now and I was afraid it would turn my skin green or something and nope its perfect. Its study for a thin ring and So cute! It's what I wanted for that extra look on my thumb! I am SO happy I bought this!
"
"The ring is beautiful,  correctly sized, and smooth. Some hand-made pieces I have purchased have rough spots or snags. This ring is perfect!
"
"This ring is beautiful... looks even better than the picture. It came really fast too. I would order from this vender again!!!
"
"I just got it in the mail and it is awesome.  I had a ring just like it for years but it just broke.  I put this ring on and it feels like I never broke the other one.  Thanks so much.
"
"I actually received this item sooner than I expected. The shop seller packaged the item with the utmost care. The ring was shipped in a bubble envelope and it's inside a small black reusable velvet pouch. As for the ring; it is made of high quality material and craftmanship. I didn't expect to receive a free gift along with my purchase, which is an adorable small jade nugget : ). Overall, I am a very satisfied customer and will definitely buy from this shop seller again the future.
"
"it is gorgeous, I love it, fits perfectly and it's very comfortable. They also gave me a free small jade stone. I love it
"
"I absolutely love my ring. Feel the harmony already.
"
"Absolutely love this ring, I have small fingers so I'm always cautious purchasing rings and forgiving out sizing but the sizing for this ring is very spot on! Thank you!!
"
"I love it! It glows really strongly. I'll drive to work and the sunlight is enough to make it glow pretty clearly for most of the opening process, even though it isn't pitch dark. It's a very pretty blue (I got the turquoise) and is exactly as expected. Based on how it fits, I probably should've gotten the size up to account for swelling during the summer. It is the size advertised, but because of the material and shape, it is a bit less forgiving to swelling. It comes in the cutest packaging. A silver jewelry pouch and pretty business card. The only thing I'd say is order it at MINIMUM a month before you need it. It took almost 2 months to arrive, which I completely understand honestly. And she communicated updates with me so I'd know when it shipped. But I think when I ordered it, I wasn't expecting it to take so long.
"
"This ring is still one of my all time favorites. I ordered one about 4 years ago for myself and I wore it every day until I started wearing my engagement ring. My daughter also loved it but my ring size is not the same as hers so I ordered one for her and it is amazing. Her ring is the black dragon ring with a pink glow. It‚Äôs beautiful and she loves it so much she doesn‚Äôt take it off. Seriously beautiful, expertly crafted, amazing jewelry. 100% would recommend to everyone.
"
"Amazingly cool! Thr details on the ring are really impressive. Even when not glowing. It glows bright as soon as it has enough light around it. Doesn't all sunny outside for it. It includes a little flash light that you can light on the sword so it shines instantly. The more you keep the little flash light on it. The longer it will shine during the day. Thank you so much. Your craft is pure art!
"
"I‚Äôm a fan of rings, whenever I see a ring that catches my attention, then I can‚Äôt resist buying it, the shipping was good, took about 2 weeks, the ring was not damaged and packed well. The ring itself looks awesome and I got the Red glow colour effect, it looks badass in the dark and it‚Äôs a ring I‚Äôll definitely wear, the maker did an excellent job and is a handmade ring I‚Äôd buy again and recommend for anyone else to buy.

"
"I had some custom ones made for my best friends and they turned out so well! The lettering is very crisp.
"
"awesome work ... had to pay more shipping in switzerland - never had to for jewellery but i'm super happy anyway!!!
"
"The ring looks great gold may rub off just a bit around the edge of the letters it couple be my eyes.  I had it for 2 day as noticed the silver around the sides not pronounced again could be my eyes.  but it‚Äôs beautiful still and I will get 2 more eventually for my siblings.
"
"Michael is THE BEST! He takes pride in his work and it shows. I have his rings for my index fingers and middle fingers and I wanted a pinky ring to match, twice it didn‚Äôt fit just right and he was kind enough to fix it to get it to just the right size so that I‚Äôm happy! He even sent an extra pinky ring as well! I‚Äôm so happy with my rings! I wear them every single day, in the shower, pool, and to sleep and they‚Äôre great, after some time though they do get banged up or bent but that‚Äôs bc I literally wear them doing everything lol. Thank you again Michael for these timeless pieces!
"
"If your hesitant to purchase this ring or from this vendor please don‚Äôt be, hit purchase right away. The quality is great and Michael is incredible to communicate with, he went out of his way to help me with my purchase. I‚Äôm so happy with my purchase, I have worn the rings for a couple of weeks without taking it off and it looks like the day it arrive at my house. I have already purchased more rings because I love them so much and I love the stack look. This will for always be on my favorite shop list and will only buy this type of rings here/from Michael. Please note, I don‚Äôt tend to write reviews but I had to write this one because that is how happy I am with my purchase and so happy to find this vendor.
"
"Most handmade items state that they were made with love but you can actually feel it with Michael‚Äôs jewelry! It would have been easy just to ship my ring in an envelope. Instead it was wrapped with layers of love and detail. Thank you so much!
"
"I LOVE there rings. Exactly what I‚Äôve been looking for! Super small and delicate, they are amazing!
"
"High quality ring! Excellent fit, polish, and cut, at an affordable price. Susan is wonderful to work with and promptly responds to messages. Highly recommend!
"
"I'm in love with my ring! Thank you so much!! Is beautiful!!
"
"üòÅ so happy!  Great color and shade.  Lucky to find my size.  Love the purity of the jade.  Thanks.
"
"I love this ring. I place my jade yoni egg on it for display. It also looks good on my finger. Beautiful!
"
"This is a gorgeous sterling silver Mobius ring that is handmade from a 3mm wide and 1mm thick sterling silver band.  The ring is  supposed to have an elegant satin brushed finish, but Ayelet made a mistake and sent me a shiny polished ring.  I like it, so I am not going to send it back.
"
"Very fast service and the ring is beautiful.  I couldn't be happier.
"
"Beautiful ring--love the matte finish!
"
"This ring is very well crafted.  I have bought from Binster before and was not disappointed then, and am not now.  I am very pleased with this ring and will do business with Binster again.
"
"Perfect seller and item, very happy with it!
"
"Very pretty, but really thin.
"
 
 
"Love love love love love. The top photo shows the contrast in direct sunlight, and the bottom is inside. Depending on the lighting the grey will be more pronounced. (The colors seen in the bottom photo are from a stained glass window reflecting nearby!) I absolutely love this ring and am so glad we chose to order from Lena. She answered any and every question I had and the ring took only 3 days to arrive once shipped. After spending weeks looking for a salt and pepper diamond, I was thrilled to come across this listing. If you are even considering a salt and pepper diamond, do not hesitate to inquire about this beauty!
"
"So this is my second engagement ring, we got it to match my fianc√©‚Äôs wedding band since his is grey/black with black diamonds + rose gold trim. It‚Äôs so beautiful in person and people love it! 
I put a photo of the 2 ct. salt and pepper ring with rose gold alongside my original ring (not from etsy) which is a .65 center white diamond for comparison. My ring size is a 3.5. The seller was very nice and sent me a video and photo of the diamond she would use.
"
"I can‚Äôt stop staring at my new engagement ring! Honestly it‚Äôs one of the prettiest rings I‚Äôve ever seen. My fianc√© is very proud of it and I‚Äôm a very happy fianc√©e. He says his favorite part is how much I love it. Lena was amazing and patient answering all our questions about fitting it with wedding bands we had from my grandma. She even gave us a little sneak video to help with our excitement (though to be honest it was all my excitement)!  Shipping was incredibly fast! I hear nothing but compliments when people notice my ring!
"
"I just received my rings! I was pretty nervous ordering such a high dollar item on the internet but I will buy all of my jewelry from Lena at SevenCarat! The rings are absolutely stunning and everything I had hoped!
"
"This is honestly the first spoon ring I have ever bought and I am BEYOND happy with my purchase! I'm honestly very picky about certain details when it comes to the spoon ring and this hit it right outta the park. The filigree, the feel of the ring and it's not too big and gawdy and you cant complain about the price one bit compared to some of the other spoon rings that are detailed like this that run $80-$90, crazy! I will definitely be buying the other spoon ring she has in stock that resembles this one because I'm very pleased!!
"
"I stay getting complements on this ring it is so sturdy and doesn‚Äôt pinch me because it‚Äôs well made, highly recommend it :)
"
"My girlfriend loves the ring. Shipped fast too! Well worth it
"
"I love it! Very smooth on the inside, so it's comfortable to wear. The details are great, it looks just like the picture. It came sized around an 8 which is perfect for me.
"
"I‚Äôve never seen anything so amazing. It means so much to me to have this special piece of my dad with me still. I‚Äôve been so emotional today because I just love it so much. I have 3 other friends that want to order similar items! I know they won‚Äôt be disappointed! üíó
"
"I‚Äôve been waiting 4 yrs to order this ring. Babies fingerprints are impossible to capture so I was finally able to get a print at 4 yrs old. I got my daughters fingerprint and my husbands handwriting. Im very pleased! I was happily surprised by the  beautiful packaging.
"
"My fianc√© is obsessed with his ring! He‚Äôs so excited to put it on. We got him the rose gold and in all honesty I was afraid it might look too feminine, but it‚Äôs absolutely perfect on his chocolate skin!!
"
"Everything was PERFECT. The handwriting engraving I sent in is up to par. I never thought I would love a ring so much! I would definitely get something from this shop again.
"
"Beautiful ring! Fits perfectly and I am in love! I definitely will be back!
"
"It is thicker than I wanted. I ordered the medium color and half of it is quite dark. But it‚Äôs pretty. It was shipped well with careful packaging. Overall happy with this purchase.
"
"Thank you so much! I am in love with my jade ring, and it fit perfectly on my index finger. It is what I wanted. Thank you
"
"For reference I got medium jade. It‚Äôs such a gorgeous ring, I love it so much. It‚Äôs very lightweight and thinner (in a good way) compared to other jade rings I‚Äôve had.
"
"this ring is perfect! super adjustable, and the seller kept in contact with me 100% of the time. also came with conversation hearts and a sweet note!! thank you!!
"
"Super cute ring and packaging! Exactly as pictured. Fits on every finger as it is resizable. Would definitely buy from this seller again :)
"
"got my ring to say swag and well, it lived up to it that‚Äôs for sureü§©ü•∞üôèüï∫üèΩ‚ú®
"
"The ring is incredible! I had a personalisation added that made it that extra bit special and the seller was super quick to have it dispatched out to me. I will be buying again and I 100% recommend everyone else to!
"
"High quality silver and gemstone. Opal shimmers vibrant colors in sunlight. Very pleased with purchase.
"
 
 
 
"It came on time and with amazing detail. It was my first time ordering rings online so I was nervous, but it fit perfectly! My mom and I love our matching rings
"
"I purchased the Personalized Birth Flower ring and it is absolutely beautiful! The quality and the details are wonderful! I reached out and asked the owner if she could add engraving on the back of the ring and she said she could and it turned out so beautiful! I lost my sister 23 years ago and Mother‚Äôs Day can be a very difficult time for those who lost their mothers, including her own daughter. I thought it would be special to gift my niece something special that represented her own Mother‚Äôs love. My niece loves the ring! I‚Äôm so pleased, considering I was not able see the ring before it was shipped. Plus the shipping was fast considering the distance! Thank you! Thank you for your quick response to my many questions and for such beautiful, quality work! I will definitely be purchasing from Saez Custom Jewelry again! ‚ò∫Ô∏è
"
"Love this ring!
The material is spotless, the flower design beautiful! Exactly what I wanted! I'm a size UK H and it was a bit tight but nothing too uncomfortable (if you like some space in your rings - order a size up!)
"
"I absolutely love my ring! I wanted a different flower design for my birth month so I requested a custom design and they did a fantastic job! Thank you!
"
"Absolutely gorgeous ring! I do not regret purchasing it one bit.. If you are debating on whether to get it, do it! You will fall in love.. It's flawless! Thank you so much
"
"completely in love with my new ring! <3
"
"I have been looking for elephant rings forever and these are perfect! This ring is so dainty and looks exactly like the picture. I got a couple that I'm planning to give as Christmas gifts, and was so pleased at how fast they were shipped and how well the shop owner corresponded with me. I definitely would order from her again!
"
"I absolutely love this ring. I wear it almost everyday. It was true to size and I have gotten a lot of compliments. Especially from my Sorors.
"
"Ok - so I am totally obsessed, I have ordered several rings and when I say several I actually mean I have ordered more rings than I have fingers. Absolutely beautiful! Thank you üôè
"
"I've worn this ring every day for 4 weeks and I absolutely love it! It doesn't tarnish, but it does have a few dents due to me being rough with my hands! The dents give it more character and I think it looks great :) Thank you!
"
"Beautiful ring just the right width and simple edging design. Bought for myself and one for a dear friend. Arrived as stated, beautifully done box and got a discount as well. Simply beautiful!
"
"Love this minimalist ring, fits well and comfortable! I bought from ByCila's jewelry before and shipping is always fast and jewelry is of very good quality!
"
"Absolutely beautiful!  Because it‚Äôs different, it makes this ring stand out!  Arrival time was short. Pkg. was securely wrapped. Size is perfect. I want to rate a 10‚≠êÔ∏ès.   I will be purchasing again. 
Regards,
Deana S.
"
"i looooove my ring so much!! thank you
"
"i wear this ring daily and its so pretty!! it took a while to be delivered but it was worth the wait!
"
"Worth the wait. The ring is gorgeous!
"
"I am a huge outlander fan so after looking at several different shops who could make this ring I chose AdeleMiracegioielli. It took a bit longer to get the ring that anticipated, but Adele was great about communicating with me. I finally got the ring today and I absolutely love it!! I don‚Äôt know how it could get any better! Well worth the price and wait! I also received a beautiful pair of earings. I‚Äôm assuming because there was such a delay. Such a sweet gesture. Adele is amazing!
"
"Me ha encantado este anillo, es precioso, tiene el encanto de estar hecho a mano y a medida y es id√©ntico al de la serie, merece mucho la pena por su precio. Yo habl√© con Adele para que mi anillo fuese un poco m√°s brillante y claro que los que aparec√≠an en la foto y as√≠ de bonito ha quedado. Tard√≥ un poco en llegar a Espa√±a pero merece la pena la espera. Muy recomendable. üòçüíñüíç



I loved this ring, it is beautiful, it has the charm of being hand made and made to measure and is identical to the one in outlander, it is very worth it for its price. I spoke with Adele so that my ring was a bit brighter and clearer than the ones that appeared in the photo and that's how beautiful it looks. It took a while to get to Spain but it's worth the wait. Highly recommended üòçüíñüíç
"
"I absolutely love my ring. Fits perfect and reminds me of my favorite fictional couple. Thank you so much!!!
"
"The ring is very well made and looks just like the picture. I took a wrong measurement of my finger and it is too big on me, so I wear it on my thumb. Looks neat. 
Thank you!
"
"This ring is PERFECT! I ordered it in a size seven in Tan, and it is the perfect size, the perfect color, and comfortable! The one thing I would suggest is for the shop-owner to add a 'non metal' version of this ring. The ring is awesome but the copper staples in the ring itself that hold it together make your finger turn colors (which in my case is on the inside, towards my palm).

Great ring though!
"
"Obsessed with my leather rings from @thirteenelevenolive!! Excellent quality and hold their color. Only get softer with time.  Size true. Fast response & shipping time.  Thanks, Annie! üòò
"
"I love my leather ring with slits! Perfect thickness, color, size...!!
"
"I ordered a turquoise and a tan ring for my husband and I, and we both love them! I asked for our anniversary date to be added to each ring and it looks great! Customer service was awesome too! I will definitely order from this shop again.
"
"It's simply adorable!!! The ring fit my finger perfectly. Its dainty and simply but leaves a statement. Every time I look at it I smile thinking of Disney!!! And it was very well made. I've had this for almost 2 months now and its held up well without tarnishing! I would absolutely buy another one!!
"
"I love this ring! It's exactly as it appears and exactly as I expected. I should have probably sized myself a little better as it could stand to be a tad smaller. Arrived quicker than I expected after shipping notification. Would definitely purchase from this shop again.
"
"I love my ring so much, I ordered another..It‚Äôs absolutely perfect for Disney Lovers.
"
"This ring is PERFECT! Simple but disney and was exactly what I was wanting! In love!
"
"Beautiful sterling silver Huginn and Muninn ring.  Fits on my thumb.  Was put in mail super fast, and took just under 7 weeks to arrive in USA from Russia.  I love this ring.  Thank you!
"
"Well made.  Beautiful detail.  My partner loved his surprise birthday present.  Being adjustable is a bonus if you are unsure of ring size. 
 Make and shipping to Aus will take about a month though.  Be patient because it is worth the wait.
"
"Beautiful piece. Worth the wait. Photos don't do it justice. Very comfortable wearing. Wanted as a thumb ring as I have tiny fingers and fits nicely!
"
"I had previously bought a ring from this shop for my partner a few years ago that he still wears to this day. A couple of months ago I was stumped when coming up with a gift for his birthday until I remembered this shop and how beautiful the rings and necklaces are. So I stumbled upon the Odin's Ravens ring and thought he would love it. He did.

It arrived a few days after his birthday but honestly, it was worth the wait. The ring looks just like it did in the photos. Beautiful piece of work.
"
"It took a while because of customs, but it was well worth the wait because this ring is beautiful! Feels so soft on my finger and looks stunning. I couldn't be more happy with it!
"
"The ring came out so cute and came in a few days early! I‚Äôm super excited to see how it wears, but it fits perfectly and I‚Äôve already gotten so many compliments on it! Thank you for such wonderful customer service and a quality product, I will be returning
"
"Valeriy's work is awesome.  I love this ring.  He worked with me to get it to us in time for our wedding and was super quick, getting it to us a week early.  The rings were just what we wanted.
"
"I just received this ring today and I can‚Äôt stop looking at it! It‚Äôs beautiful! It fits perfectly and is so silky on the inside and comfortable I know I will wear it a lot. Excellent workmanship! Thank you!
"
"As soon as I got my ring in the mail I put it on my finger and it fit perfectly! I actually had no idea that silicone rings were a thing until I looked on Etsy. And I‚Äôm glad I found this shop. I love this ring so much!
"
"Very fast shipping and the ring came in perfect condition. I accidentally ordered a size too large, but decided to keep this one as a back up instead of returning it. The quality is well worth the price, absolutely recommend!
"
"Ordered this for my husband while we have to spend some time apart. I ordered from Ireland to be delivered to my husband in FL, USA and it was with him in 4 days! We ordered two sizes because we weren‚Äôt sure but one fits perfectly and one is just a little tight that could be used for backup! 
Such good quality and great to have if you‚Äôre in a career field that puts you in a position to use your hands a lot. 
Thank you!
"
"I originally got my husband a groove ring, but it turned out to be too bulky. This is slimmer and all over a better fit. We both love it.
"
"Beautiful thin pave ring in white gold. Pictured here with 2mm white gold band and 4mm yellow gold band, for my own funky stack. Very pretty packaging, and shipped in time. Ferko was incredibly responsive over messaging to all my questions and kept me up to date. Ring is well made. And you can't beat the price for a conflict free full eternity band!  Thanks Ferko!!
"
"Love this beautiful, dainty ring. I‚Äôve always wanted a full eternity band and finally have one. The diamonds are sparkly and the gold is smooth and shiny. I‚Äôm currently pregnant and my fingers haveswollen which make my wedding set uncomfortable. This one is perfect because it‚Äôs thin enough to feel like I‚Äôm not even wearing anything. Great product!
"
"I purchased the gold infinity ring and it‚Äôs absolutely stunning!! The ring is exactly like the pictures but better and pairs perfectly with my engagement ring. I‚Äôm really happy I pulled the trigger and bought it! Thank you FerkosFineJewelry!!
"
"This ring is perfect! I absolutely love it. It is the perfect band to go with my trillion engagement ring, it doesn't take away from it, but shines in it's own way- the perfect compliment to it! And the width is exactly what I was looking for as well, as I do not like a lot of jewelry on my hands or wrists, I need a smaller thinner ring. You can't find this thin of a band anywhere where I am. Thank you so much! It will be well loved forever!
"
"I have several of Galyna's rings. They are all so beautiful and beautifully made.  I also now have a really pretty pair of her earrings.  I can't say enough how happy I am with my purchases.
"
"The ring is stunning and the care taken to package it came straight from the heart. Thank you!!
"
"These are spectacular I love love love them high quality and colors are vibrant and I‚Äôm always surprised with her quality and colors are so beautiful‚Äîalso they are not too heavy for my ears and I‚Äôm older and my ears pull down and these work!  Durability appears to be there as well‚ÄîI just received all of her earrings so hoping they will last and I‚Äôm very careful with these kinds of earrings‚Äîso very happy with purchase always and ordered three more because these are my outfits working on zoom all the time!
"
"Super adorable!! I bought them for my wedding and they were absolutely perfect for our butterfly bluff ceremony. I've gotten so many compliments on them, I can't wait to wear them more.
"
"I bought the rose gold ring and I love it! Super cute and goes with everything. The fit is great, and it's unbelievably comfortable for a ring. I would highly recommend anything from Le Cubicle, and will definitely be coming back for more.
"
"LOVE. It's adorable. I like the hammered look. And it came in a cute little metal box - what a nice touch. :)
Be careful taking it off - be gentle, don't pull!
My dad had made me a thick true silver spiral ring for my finger; it did not bend, it was solid.  I lost it.  He's since passed away.  This ring you have to be careful.....with the warm weather, my finger swelled and when I tried to get the ring off, the rings spread apart and I had to squish them back together again (looks fine, but I know one of the rings is not as it should be, oops!).  I still love it and it's still a reminder of my dad :)
"
"I love the ring. It arrives nicely packaged. What I love about it is that I can stretch it out to be taller on my finger, and make it shorter without it losing it's shape. Thank you!
"
"10 stars -- This ring is so beautiful - excellent craftsmanship - as described.  Received on time ... great customer service/good communication ... seller changed ring size for me mid-order!  Would highly recommend this artist.  I will purchase from her again.  Merci beaucoup - love it!
"
"Amazing Overall! The ring is incredibly detailed and looks just like the pictures. I have yet to wear it though, so I don‚Äôt know if it will stain the fingers. Overall very pleased with this product!
"
"I bought this ring as a gift, and it turned out perfect. It came very quickly, and arrived in time even though I ordered pretty late. I was a little worried about the quality when I ordered it, but after receiving it, I can confidently say that the quality seems very good. The item is exactly as pictured and I am super happy with my purchase.
"
"Looks great!
"
"Amazing quality and looks amazing. It shipped before the estimated time!!
"
"Wow! This ring is gorgeous. I am so glad I ordered this. I had been looking at items similar, but they were all adjustable rings. This one is sized. I just got it today and put it right on. Been waiting.
"
"Beautiful ring! Really well made.
"
 
"Bought this as a gift for a friend, and she loves it! It's beautiful and feels really well made.
"
"Obsessed with these rings! I got this one and the brown one. They shipped so fast and I got them in 2 days ‚ù§Ô∏è
"
"these rings are adorable! i got the dark brown. i only wish there wasn‚Äôt a gap in between the ring but still fits perfect and is super comfortable!
"
"I‚Äôm in love with this little ring. It arrived so quickly and is a perfect fit. It‚Äôs my own little gift to myself!
"
"Absolutely beautiful! I wear one on each thumb and one on each middle finger! They are beautiful.
Thank you,
Susan
"
"I ordered a personalised ring for my boyfriend, and it was absolutely perfect, couldn't be happier with it, and Sophie was an absolute star with helping me choose the right size and was so kind and polite! Would recommend to everyone! 
The personalisation was such a special touch! Brilliant service, came so quickly as wellüòÅ <3
"
"Such good quality. The best customer service. Would definitely recommend. The ring is so smooth and feels so nice and such lovely engraving!
"
"I am really happy with this ring. I opted to inscribe the inside and it has turned out really well. The ring is well made and comfortable and it arrived quickly. Totally recommend!
"
"So in love with what I got hardly take it off!!
"
"even though it took a long time for them to get here (which is understandable because i live in the US plus the holidays slow the postal service down tremendously) i am more than satisfied with these beautiful rings !!!! i can't wait to give the other half to my partner !!! <3
"
"Both rings are beautiful and well crafted. The inscription is exactly what we wanted. The print  is pretty small, but it is very clear. 
I love this ring and wear it everyday. It is very comfortable.
"
"The rings fit perfectly and look exactly how I wanted them to! My fianc√© loved his ring as well. :)
"
"Love the rings, the engraving looked perfect! Only thing I would say is to be sure of your ring size before buying.
"
"As others have noted, it took a while to get here (> 3 weeks), but it looks great! The packaging is thoughtful, as it comes in an adorable little box. I asked Sergei to engrave my wedding date inside the ring, which he did (clearly by hand, which gives it some personality). This ring is exactly what I was looking for. Therefore, completely worth the wait. Thank you!
"
"Absolutely unique ring. So beautiful and simple. And it came in such gorgeous packaging! Can‚Äôt thank you enough. A lifetime of happiness is represented in this ring!
"
"This is so perfect. My fianc√© loves it and the engraving makes it special since he wanted a very simple and small ring. We postponed the wedding but decided to wear our wedding bands anyway because we got excited when we saw them
"
"I purchased this for my husband after getting married in november. I ordered in the beginning of january and it arrived mid february. The shipping took the longest, but it was coming from across the globe so I am not bothered. It is beautiful and matches his style very well, he loves it too. I picked this out for him myself
"
"The rings were nice and packaged in a cute little white tulle bag. I was surprised at how light the state names and year were,we had to put them in the light to make out which was which,and I was a little disappointed because they didn't really resemble the pictures, which looked darker with everything much more defined. I started to take a picture of them but realized as I took the pic, it made the rings look...a little darker and better defined so in all fairness it wasn't the seller's fault, it's how the pics came out. We bought them for sentimental reasons and we will keep and be happy with them for that reason. But be aware the rings will probably be lighter and fainter than you are expecting, if you're good with that you will love them.

"Love my California quarter ring! It's definitely true to size. I got a 10 and I could have gone with a 9.5 I wear it as a thumb ring and the only thing I don't like about it is the coloring it leaves on your finger from the nickel in the metal. But you just have to take it off at night and even wear it in the shower to wash it up and wear it in kind of. I'd love one made out of an old real silver quarter! Five stars. Great people and shop.
"
"Rally love the idea of this and it made a great 25th anniversary present but, unfortunately, left his finger green
"
"Super awesome price for quality cool ring. Comfortable, pretty and nice looking. Highly recommend. Good shipping
"
"Love this ring! My fianc√© is not a jewelry guy AT ALL. Every time we talked about getting him a ring he would talk about how he just doesn‚Äôt like jewelry and isn‚Äôt a ‚Äúring‚Äù guy. So when we found these I was surprised he liked them enough to settle on it. Well I‚Äôm glad he did because he loves and I love it and it goes perfect with our lifestyle, theme and matches my rose gold ring.
"
"Couldn‚Äôt have asked for a more handsome anniversary ring for my husband! I originally forgot to fill out that I wanted it engraved/burned, contacted the seller, and he got back to me immediately and still made it happen! I am so thankful for it, and my husband couldn‚Äôt be happier! Thank you!
"
"Highly recommended this shop and their products. I had to exchange my ring for a different size. This couldn‚Äôt have been easier. The ring is beautiful and looks just like the pictures.
"
"I finally gave my wife her ring on our one year wedding anniversary ! It‚Äôs so beautiful it fits perfect ü§© she absolutely loves it the delivery process was so fast. Thanks soo much
"
"The ring is absolutely beautiful and a truly unique work of art. 

The package arrived 11 days after I ordered it, which I consider being relatively quick for standard mail (I live in the US). The ring was packaged in a little box, and this box was in an individually wrapped potpourri of dried rose petals, live ferns, and ribbon. I was delighted. 

The ring fits well, and I am very happy with it.
"
"I absolutely LOVE this ring!! It is gorgeous and shipped on time in the world's cutest packaging with pine and flower petals. Unfortunately, it did break after about two weeks.
"
"Absolutly awesome. I love the Ring and wear him every Day. At the first order i have done an Mistake at the Size, now my Husband is happy and i get a very nice Ring as ""Mistakepresent"" from Irene.
If you think about to order here...DO IT! :)
"
"Not only was this ring ABSOLUTELY STUNNING, but Irene worked tirelessly to make sure the ring was *exactly* what we wanted, and the right size. Beautiful product and a lovely seller, what more could you want? HIGHLY RECOMMEND!
"
"i love this ring .   so pretty  and  dainty.

"magnifique, unique et tr√®s bien travaill√©, des dimensions coh√©rentes; ma femme est ravie
"
"Love this ring...perfect for a dainty hand.
"
"They're beautiful, as always. I have a nice collection started.
"
"I absolutely love this ring. I wear this every day. I have tiny fingers (my ring finger is a size 4) and I wear this one on my pointer. Had to adjust it of course but it wasn‚Äôt hard to do at all. Thank you!!
"
"I absolutely love this ring!! I have really big fingers (size 10 for the finger the ring is on) so I have a hard time finding rings that fit but this fits perfectly, I didn't even have to adjust it! The design is beautiful! The only downside is that it does turn my finger a little green, but it's not a big deal at all.
"
"I ordered both of these rings, and love them! Great quality for the price! I wanted them to wear on my pinky-finger, but theyre a little too big: fits well on my other fingers though! Good product and fast shipping! Very pleased with purchase and will order again C:
"
"love itüòçüíï

"Beautiful ring, excellently made and very nicely packaged. The braided twist adds a touch of elegance and is very chic. I have worn everyday and was subjected to lots of water; gold finish has faded a tad bit, but hardly noticeable. Worth the shipping to the US. Much love, ‚ù§Ô∏è
"
"Beautiful ring, intricate braid, love this minimalist look! Quick shipping from Spain to Toronto, Canada! Highly recommend. Thanks.
"
"Die Ringe sind super filigran und sch√∂n. Der Versand nach Deutschland war so schnell wie noch nie. Ich plane bereits den n√§chsten Kauf! <3
"
"The tiny ring has arrived yesterday, just a few days after ordering it. This is excellent!

The ring itself is very classy and exactly as described on Etsy. I love it! 

It's a 100% good experience :)
"
"Jason, Received my ring today and I absolutely love it!  The ring with black patina is very cool, (better looking in person).  The size was perfect. It has become my new wedding band. I will definitely show it to my friends. Thanks again,  Bill
"
"OMG ! This coin ring from CoinCraftersShop is a Masterpiece.  I strongly recommend  black powder coat option.  It makes the ring even more stunning.  Most importantly, CoinCrafters made and delivered the ring on spec and on schedule and keep me informed and stayed in contact. Great shop!  I will most definitely want to buy more from here.
"
"You crafted this silver dollar ring for my grandfather who I love beyond anything in this world. I explained to you how he got his name ""silver dollar"" and his time serving in WWII, hair Purple Heart and many more accolades. I am absolutely floored and you brought me to tears of sheer joy that not only did this ring turn out beyond stunning, you went that extra mile and wrote to him specifically thanking him for his service and sacrifices. Thank you from the bottom of my heart for this. He's 91 years young and is going to be just as floored when he receives this wonderful momento of not only my gratuity for him but from your company as well.

Thank you for your expedient service and your beyond professionalism by going above and beyond. I am truly humbled and so grateful. 

Thank you again!!!!!!! ‚ù§Ô∏èüá∫üá∏
"
"I Love-Love-Love It!!!

The Fit is perfect and true to size.
Great workmanship with a very detailed clean finish.
GREAT PRICE! Well worth the money. Shipped very fast.

Exceeded all my expectations.

Thank You So Much :)

"Ravi d'avoir achet√© une nouvelle bague √† daimblond, elle est superbe en tout point. La bague est √©galement arriv√©e tr√®s rapidement, merci !
"
"Sehr freundliche Verk√§uferin und super Service! Der Ring passte nicht und wurde sofort umgetauscht. Das Schmuckst√ºck ist au√üergew√∂hnlich und sch√∂n verarbeitet.
"
"Elles est vraiment magnifique ! Merci !
"
"It was as beautiful as the picture, I absolutely love it and so does my husband :)
"
"Absolutely beautiful- exactly what I wanted for my wedding band. Cannot beat this unbelievable price either. I am looking forward to purchasing another band so I can stack it alongside this band and my engagement ring. Stunning- I'm so happy!
"
"I love my two diamond bands....I stacked them on either side of my other ring and it is perfect. Even better than I imagined! I love them! ü•∞
"
"Gorgeous ring! Have searched for years to find the perfect eternity band to go with my engagement ring. Just the right amount of bling.

I will certainly be back!
"
"Beautiful ring that I will wear in a few months as my wedding band.  I wanted a subtle, but feminine, wedding band with a bit of glimmer and this was a perfect selection.  The quality is wonderful and it looks very nice and natural next to my plain, 18K White Gold band.  
Zina responded immediately to my questions and the shipment was speedy.  Ring was very protected in shipping material in came in a lovely gift box.
"
"I really love this ring.
The fit is comfotable.
I am enjoying it
Thank you.
"
"Love this carnelian ring (the dark orange second closest to the center of my hand), looks great with the addition of other colored rings I have!
"
"I like my carnelian ring. It is simple and beautiful.
"
"It is a very dainty ring, I have owned a few thicker in width ring. So this one seems extremely tiny. I did not read description, so please read. I wish I had gotten two rings instead of one!
"
"I ordered a personalised ring for my boyfriend, and it was absolutely perfect, couldn't be happier with it, and Sophie was an absolute star with helping me choose the right size and was so kind and polite! Would recommend to everyone! 
The personalisation was such a special touch! Brilliant service, came so quickly as wellüòÅ <3
"
"Such good quality. The best customer service. Would definitely recommend. The ring is so smooth and feels so nice and such lovely engraving!
"
"I am really happy with this ring. I opted to inscribe the inside and it has turned out really well. The ring is well made and comfortable and it arrived quickly. Totally recommend!
"
"So in love with what I got hardly take it off!!
"
"Love this ring especially for a thumb ring beautifully made looks even better on love her jewelry peices I purchased more!! All my fav's ‚ù£Ô∏è
"
"Stunning
"
"Gorgeous quality excellent shipping long
"
"I love this ring!  I bought it large enough to wear on my thumb while I video making my jewelry.  Thank you for the beautiful design!!!
"
"I was a little nervous about ordering something like this online and from so far away, but I'm so happy I went for it. This ring is AMAZING. I ordered it as a wedding band, and I was worried that the cubic zirconia would look noticeably different from my diamond, but it looks beautiful with my engagement ring. I almost cried when I put it on!!
"
"I am so obsessed!! The ring came in super quickly, and it‚Äôs everything I wanted. It looks just like the pictures, the studs are super shiny and match my engagement ring so well!
"
"I did not expect this to come in the prettiest box! The fit was as expected, it is very comfortable, and actually too shiny compared to my engagement ring. Overall it is an amazing ring for a reasonable price.
"
"VERY happy with my purchase!! the quality is amazing & goes wonderfully with my oval cut engagement ring. a perfect alternative for a wedding band & stands alone great as well!!! ‚ô°

"I love this ring!  I bought it large enough to wear on my thumb while I video making my jewelry.  Thank you for the beautiful design!!!
"
"I'm absolutely in love with this ring! The details are spot on and it's just the right size to see the details but not too wide. What I love the most though? It's sturdy! Oftentimes on here the rings you get sent are very light and I've had rings just snap right off after a couple weeks. This ring is great quality. I couldn't be happier :)
"
"I absolutely love this ring. I was going to purchase one like this from a large company for 3x the price but it was out of my budget and this one is so high quality. no greening or anything! in love!!
"
"This ring is so pretty! I ordered it for my pinky. My fingers are very small and I can never find rings in size 3 for my pinky fingers. This is the perfect dainty ring for my little hands.
"
"I absolutely love love love this ring (the daisy ring). I can‚Äôt take it off! I‚Äôm so happy I decided to buy it :)
"
"This is the most comfortable ring I‚Äôve ever worn. After having a wood ring and then two volcanic inlay rings fall apart on me, it was time for something a bit more rugged but still unique. This ring is beautiful in its simplicity while still being striking in appearance. And again, so light and comfortable to wear. I‚Äôm a carbon fiber fan for life! Great, accommodating, fast service as well. A+ all around!
"
"I bought this ring for my husband bc he wanted a black band and loves cars so I figured carbon fiber would be the way to go. The first band we ordered was too small because his fingers swell quite a bit depending on the temperature. I messaged Judy and Bobby and they responded very quickly letting me know I could order a new size and they would send a prepaid shipping slip with the new ring for me to return the old one. I was a little concerned about the process to ship the ring back but they made it so easy and simple. The delivery was really quick, each ring was delivered in just a few days of putting in the order. It‚Äôs amazing quality and was such an ease to work with them. They kept me updated and overall was a great experience. Oh and my husband loves his ring!
"
"I bought the unidirectional carbon fiber ring but when I got it my fiance was not happy with the finish and said he preferred the twill. I messaged the seller and they were more than happy to exchange the ring for the twill finish one. We got it yesterday and my fiance loves it! It's light weight and looks stylish so much better than the tungsten ring he had been wearing. Tungsten is so heavy and thick! My fiance says this new ring barely feels like it's there and is so comfortable.
"
"It‚Äôs a beautiful ring! My bf is obsessed with carbon fiber so I surprised him for our anniversary with matching rings! We love it!
"
"Seller is extremely responsive and nice! Was willing to do my request and it came much faster than I anticipated. Wonderful product!
"
"I'm very happy with this ring.  It has a good design that balances simplicity with repeating detail and can take some abuse as I bang around with it.
"
"i've just received my ring. I'm very happy and it's really good job.
Thank you.
"
"Amazing. Fits perfectly and looks even better in person.
"
"Beautiful ring, stunning in its simplicity. Unfortunatly my ring was too small. Natsumi was brilliant, offering me several solutions to achieve satisfaction for us both. Very patient. Thank you so much.
"
"Love my Ring!!
It fits perfectly, matches the 2nd like I wanted and the Customer Service, Packaging plus Quality is Beautiful. 
The ring shipped so quick I've been waiting a week to write the review : )
I have nothing but wonderful things to say about my ring and the very kind, Owner
Take Care,
Namaste
"
"Love love love my ring! I was looking for something simple and dainty but still classy and this fit the bill perfectly! It shipped super quick (I'm in the U.S.); I had it within a few weeks of ordering. And the fit was true to size, so it fits perfectly :) Thank you so much for the beautiful ring!
"
"Love my new ring. Exactly what I wanted and looks awesome with my other rings.
"
"I absolutely love my new pinky ring! As soon as I saw it, I knew it would become one of those cool, timeless pieces that would fit in well with both my modern and vintage jewelry... and I was right! Shipped way faster than expected, too, despite the fact that I asked for a custom size. Thanks, Chuck!
"
"LOVE this ring! I ordered it to wear in front of my wedding ring, which is too large and often falls off. It looks amazing with my meteorite wedding band. The double Ouroboros is so original, elegant and edgy- exactly what I looked for this entire past year. Hand-made to perfection!
"
"This ring is even more stunning in person. I am very pleased with this purchase and the interaction I had with the creator, Chuck. He sent me a ring sizer free of charge to get the proper measurements and shipped my ring in record time! I can't recommend this shop more. Beautiful work and great customer service.
"
"Beautiful ring, so unique and elegant design. Exactly my style and the accessory I didn‚Äôt know I needed until I saw it. I will definitely revisit this shop in the near future. Shop also sent me a free ring sizer so I could fit the ring to a certain finger perfectly. Thank you DownToTheWireDesigns!
"
"Very nice set. Only had a chance to use some of them so far.... but they are very nice tools and will do exactly what I need them to do! love the little cones and the extra ram spacer to use under my mandrel. Makes it so I don‚Äôt have to keep moving back and fourth from mandrel to arbor... I just removed the circle part of the mandrel and use its ram rod. Trust me you won‚Äôt be disappointed with this set! Excellent customer service as well! Requested a special reducer and no questions asked he made it happen for me. Will def order more tools from seller if/when needed.
"
"These dies are exactly as described! I have made my first ever ring and other than the fact that I punch my hole slightly off center (causing the band to be slightly thicker on one side vs the other) and I overheated on the first anneal causing permanent discoloration and I didn't pay attention on the first fold and made the ring tail side out I was able to produce a perfect size 6.5 without any problem in just 30 minutes from start to finish....looking forward to perfecting my technique using these highly polished dies. May try correcting the uneven band by restretching and reducing again but it is so slight I may just leave it alone and just save it as my first ring and leave it at that!
"
"Very nice polished finish.  Much better than I expected.
I just wish I hadn't waited so long to order. Would have made my ring making much easier.  Oh well, I have them now.
"
"Received these today, had 6 coins punched and ready to fold. Changes the game in ring making, took me no time at all to completly fold all 6 coins (Morgans to dimes) and begin streching and sizing them. cut the time 75%  and the  quality is amazing. Wouldn't buy from anybody else.
"
"Beautiful ring! Very happy with my purchase!
"
"i am seriously OBSESSED with this band - i love everything about it! i‚Äôve had my eye on a wedding band like this forever, but big box stores don‚Äôt have many of this style and charge WAY more. this shop offers this in many sizes and colors and it‚Äôs exactly what i was looking for. it goes perfectly with my engagement ring (about 1 carat if anyone is curious for related sizing). i was between 1.8mm and 1.5mm band but i‚Äôm glad i went with the larger size because it is perfectly dainty against my other ring. gagik was  incredibly responsive and accommodating and even engraved my band for free. i will definitely order from this shop again
"
"I bought this gold and diamond band to match with my engagement set. It pairs perfectly with my white gold band and engagement ring set. In the middle of this pandemic, Master Jeweler came through. I am so pleased with my ring! Now my stacking ring set up is complete!
"
"I absolutely love this ring! My engagement ring has a thin band so I needed something dainty to go with it, and it goes perfectly! Additionally, it shipped quickly. :)
"
"This shop is amazing!!!!  Emily was wonderful to work with.   I wanted a special engraving that's special to my husband and myself.   She got back to me the same day, worked with me every step and I got the ring in amazingly fast pace!  The ring is prettier in person and looks fabulous stacked with my other wedding band!  The best part...my husband loves it too!!!!   Thank you so much emily!  I'll definately be back!!!
"
"So happy with this ring. The engraved pattern is beautiful. 
I ordered from the uk so it took almost a month to arrive and I had to pay a customs charge but it was worth it. 
I will definitely be ordering more of your lovely jewellery. 
Thank you x
"
"This ring is absolutely gorgeous and just what I needed. Emily was amazing to work with and very understanding of my situation. The intricacies of the waves are very small, but it's still beautiful!
"
"I recieved my order today and I love it. I like all the little cards that came with my beautiful ring. One of them said my ring was made by Bobby. So I want to say thank you to Bobby! this is very cool and so detailed I find myself staring at it trying to see all the twist and turns. You are very skilled thank you so much.
"
 
"Such a beautiful stacking ring and exactly as pictured. My husband bought it for me to go with my engagement diamond, as my wedding band can sometimes feel a bit flashy to wear with the diamond day-to-day. We got this for me to wear on the other days and it compliments it perfectly! Thank you so much! ‚ú®
"
"Such a  gorgeous, very beautiful ring! It's prettier than I thought:) The ring is well made and unique, perfect work. I'm happy!! 
Dany (the owner/artist) was very responsive and helped a lot with a difficult delivery situation. Thank you so very much :)
"
"Very pretty ring!  I asked for it to be left more on the matte side, and I think it looks very cool!  Ring kind of glows.
"
"The ring is amazing !
Josie did an excellent job of crafting my fraternity ring.
Shipping was slow but it was worth the wait !
"
"Great quality and arrived fast! I can't wait to give it to my fianc√© as a gift! I know he is gonna love it! It's exactly what I wanted! Really well made and better than I thought! Thank you üíï
"
"PERFECT Thank you! It's weighty and arrived in fair time given all that a gwan ina world !!
"
"I bought this ring as a gift and it's one of the best gifts I've ever given. Looks awesome, so unique. GET ONE.
"
"I can‚Äôt stop staring at my new engagement ring! Honestly it‚Äôs one of the prettiest rings I‚Äôve ever seen. My fianc√© is very proud of it and I‚Äôm a very happy fianc√©e. He says his favorite part is how much I love it. Lena was amazing and patient answering all our questions about fitting it with wedding bands we had from my grandma. She even gave us a little sneak video to help with our excitement (though to be honest it was all my excitement)!  Shipping was incredibly fast! I hear nothing but compliments when people notice my ring!
"
"Words can‚Äôt even describe how impressed I was! At first I was skeptical ordering a ring without seeing it in person. However I‚Äôm so glad I did! Lena was amazing throughout the whole process! My boyfriend and I picked out this ring together as my engagement ring, but has not yet proposed, so waiting to officially wear it! Highly recommend this shop! They were very flexible with payments and doing custom sizing. Couldn‚Äôt have had a better experience!
"
"Love love love love love. The top photo shows the contrast in direct sunlight, and the bottom is inside. Depending on the lighting the grey will be more pronounced. (The colors seen in the bottom photo are from a stained glass window reflecting nearby!) I absolutely love this ring and am so glad we chose to order from Lena. She answered any and every question I had and the ring took only 3 days to arrive once shipped. After spending weeks looking for a salt and pepper diamond, I was thrilled to come across this listing. If you are even considering a salt and pepper diamond, do not hesitate to inquire about this beauty!
"
"So this is my second engagement ring, we got it to match my fianc√©‚Äôs wedding band since his is grey/black with black diamonds + rose gold trim. It‚Äôs so beautiful in person and people love it! 
I put a photo of the 2 ct. salt and pepper ring with rose gold alongside my original ring (not from etsy) which is a .65 center white diamond for comparison. My ring size is a 3.5. The seller was very nice and sent me a video and photo of the diamond she would use.
"
"Another wonderful piece! Love the little details and I hardly notice I have it on, but very well done!great addition to my now endlessly growing collection of toe rings! Thanks again!
"
"I love this ring! The design is super stylish & it shipped much quicker than I anticipated. Tracy even helped troubleshoot an unexpected shipping error for me, and her customer service was above and beyond. I definitely recommend both the seller and the ring!
"
"It's so shiny!! And the hammer look gives it a bit of a sparkle without overdoing it.  I'm just so impressed with the quality!! The shipping and delivery was super quick as well. Thanks SOOO much Tracy. You'll definitely have my business again. üòÅ
"
"I love this v ring! It is nice and thick, very sturdy.  I've had other thinner thumb rings before that ended up bending and breaking pretty easily.  This one is much better and hasn't come close to bending yet.  Love it!
"
"Very interesting and pretty ring.  I ordered a 1/4 larger size  than my normal size because of the wide band, and I wish I had ordered a 1/2 size larger.  The ring will fit better in Winter, without Summer heat making fingers a little bigger, so I will wear it.  Shipping was incredibly fast from India to Nevada!  Quite pleasant surprise. Yes, I would buy again from this vendor.
"
"I am in LOVE with this ring... im going to buy another from this sell... it us just so well made and beautiful.   I put it on and don't plan on taking it off EVER!!!
"
"Absutely perfect i just love it i didnt think it was actually sterling till it came and i wore it without my finger itching from nickel or fake silver usual .. i am happy to say its  defintatel sterling! And ill never take it off ill even be back for.   Another!  Thank you  !

"Gorgeous quality excellent shipping long

"I love this ring!  I bought it large enough to wear on my thumb while I video making my jewelry.  Thank you for the beautiful design!!!
"
"Exactly what I was looking for - a subtle, classy, every day ring. I purchased 2, one hammered and one smooth, and I love them both. The seller was so incredibly helpful and kind when I entered the wrong delivery address too. No dark spots left under these rings and I can wear them stacked or separated. Thank you so much!
"
"These rings (I ordered two, to stack) are exactly what I wanted, except I thought I was getting rose gold, that's my mistake.  Still, they stack nicely with my other three rings on that finger - nice hammered finish!  Came in a reasonable amount of time, considering it is a hand-made item.  I will do business with Kenrae Designs again - except now I'm looking for rose gold rings, just like these!  Thanks!
"
"This is my 5th ring from Kenrae designs and I absolutely love them! l leave these dainty rings on 24/7 and they are the perfect accent for larger rings too.
"
"It is exactly what I wanted to add a two tone option to my stacking rings. And very affordable. Thx!
"
"Recommended
"
"The ring is beautiful, but unfortunately it turns my finger green whenever I wear it, which makes me wonder what it truly is made out of. I will probably have to put clear nail polish on the inside in order to be able to wear it.
"
"This ring is lovely. I understand why it took longer for delivery with events in the world. I'll buy again from this shop
"
"Better than the picture!  Beautiful! Just know shipping takes a while cause it's coming from India.
"
"It's beautiful! And Alon was friendly and professional through the whole thing. If you're worried about getting things on time during the corona mailing times, I highly recommend paying the extra shipping! It came here to Jersey super fast, all the way from Israel! Thank you!
"
 
"Tiny print almost illegible but otherwise great ring
"
"Due to the season, it was a little delayed, but still quite acceptable.
"
"I have several of Galyna's rings. They are all so beautiful and beautifully made.  I also now have a really pretty pair of her earrings.  I can't say enough how happy I am with my purchases.
"
"These are spectacular I love love love them high quality and colors are vibrant and I‚Äôm always surprised with her quality and colors are so beautiful‚Äîalso they are not too heavy for my ears and I‚Äôm older and my ears pull down and these work!  Durability appears to be there as well‚ÄîI just received all of her earrings so hoping they will last and I‚Äôm very careful with these kinds of earrings‚Äîso very happy with purchase always and ordered three more because these are my outfits working on zoom all the time!
"
"Super adorable!! I bought them for my wedding and they were absolutely perfect for our butterfly bluff ceremony. I've gotten so many compliments on them, I can't wait to wear them more.
"
"OMG OMG OMG they are beautiful more beautiful than i imagined and they hang beautifully as well‚ÄîI‚Äôm going to order more of her products they rock and thank you MAHALO so happy i ordered them
"
"This is a very nice looking ring in rose gold.  For me, it is a tiny bit snug (fit) but it is still very comfortable.   

I Would recommend this ring and this vendor. üòä
"
"I absolutely love this ring, how dainty and bright it is! I love looking at it!
"
"Stunning. Delicate. Perfect. Classy. Understated. Meaningful. I am in love with this ring I wear with another ring from this same shop.
"
"It's beautiful and fits perfectly between my wedding band and my engagement ring
"
"Absolutely beautiful. The craftsmanship is superb. The sizing is perfect. I love the way it glows in the dark. I will definitely be returning to buy more from this seller in the future.
Thank you for a beautiful ring.
"
"This ring is sooo beautiful. I can't say enough nice things about it! The craftsmanship is awesome, it glows FOREVER (seriously I had to put it in a drawer cause it was keeping me awake-which is way cool)
The owner is very pleasant and easy to deal with. 

I am definitely buying from this shop again!
"
"I Love this Ring so much I bought two! Thank you for all your hard work. And I receved it fast!
"
"The ring is gorgeous! It was supposed to be a wedding ring but the marriage didn't happen. It would have worked wonderfully, however. Very good quality. Awesome seller! So kind, was willing to work with us. Just love this shop!
"
"I never, never ever write any reviews even if I like items I get very much. Just too much work. But this experience is beyond what words could express. I would give 20 stars if I could. Carrissa was absolutely amazing to work with. My order was extremely complicated. I ordered 19 graduation rings and each of them had a slightly different design. I wanted to make sure they would look the way I intended, so I asked Carissa to send me a picture when the first one was made and she did, and she worked with me with every one of my annoyances and I sent her multiple messages, and she made me absolutely happy. Just exactly what I wanted and how I wanted them to be done. I couldn't believe that for such a small price I would get such an amazing piece of art. Thank you! I absolutely LOVE all the rings and they are very very special!
"
"I just got this ring in the mail... In love is not even the words to describe it! It is a well made ring and I love the detail. It came quicker than I expected and it was a great price. One of my favorite finds!
"
"Love everything about this ring! Perfect size, great price, quick delivery, and so cute! I like that the ring is adjustable. Originally I thought I would wear it on my pointer finger, but I ended up wearing it on my thumb. ""It is Well with my Soul"" is my favorite hymn and the first Sunday I wore it to Church, the organist actually played the song during the worship service.
"
"I love this ring! Have received so many compliments and have only had it for a few days. I get to share Jesus with everyone and tell my story of His grace and mercy!
"
"Merci pour cette belle bague ! Elle est arriv√©e rapidement dans son emballage tr√®s mignon et pratique. Elle correspond √† mes attentes <3. Tr√®s bonne qualit√© et en plus on privil√©gie le local, il n'y a rien de mieux.
"

"
"This ring is gorgeous, true to size, and exactly as described, as you can see. 

Moreover, the seller was extremely helpful, answered all my questions, and went above and beyond to make sure I was satisfied with this product. 

I highly recommend this product and this vendor.
"

"
 
"Love the simplicity of this ring. Fits as expected and looks great on. Very happy with this purchase.
"
"Beautiful ring. I have a hard time finding rings that fit and it's harder ordering online. I love that it's slightly adjustable by design and it's super pretty, too. I did receive it very quickly and it came beautifully packaged. Thank you!
"
"the rings are just as pictured. dainty and beautiful! it arrived in a timely manner in cute packaging. i will definitely be purchasing from this shop again!
"
"Absolutely gorgeous piece of jewelry. Definitely a favourite ‚ò∫Ô∏è will absolutely be back
"
"I absolutely love my new ring!
I wanted a ring from my little finger and loved this design - had to contact the designer as my finger is so small and she made one to my size! Absolutely fabulous quality and great design. The ring was delivered within 5 days of ordering too - and was received in beautiful packaging with a lovely note.
Cannot fault this seller or the product! Highly recommend.
"
"I love this ring, it‚Äôs beautifully made and very dainty. Would definitely recommend.
"
"Absolutely gorgeous dainty ring, beautiful hammered silver. Exactly what I was looking for üíï
"
"I really love my ring. The owner worked with me to customize the size (she only had whole and 1/2 sizes, but I need 1/4 size). She even followed up after the product was delivered. End to end service I would highly suggest her products.
"
"Awesome ring! Beautiful!
"
"Nice little ring. I‚Äôm a mechanic so this thing is going to get beat up. But the past two weeks or so it‚Äôs been doing just fine. Comfortable and light. For the price. Can‚Äôt really beat it.
"
"Beautiful hand made jewelry.  I love this shop
"
"The band is beautiful! I searched a lot for my wedding band with no luck, I had very specific small details in mind when looking - this was perfect, exactly what I envisioned. I can't wait till I can start wearing it!
"
"Beautiful! Love it and can‚Äôt wait to start wearing it!
"
"I am overall happy with the ring, but was highly disappointed with shipping and customer service issues.  I had read many good reviews, but when my ring hadn't shipped out after 10 business days, I contacted the shop to learn that it would take another 1-2 days.  I waited for the promised tracking number, as outlined in the shop's policies, and when I hadn't received one 4 days later, contacted the shop again, where I was told I had missed the delivery at my house that morning, because it required a signature.  How would I have arranged for someone to sign for it if I hadn't even know it shipped??  Great ring but for something so valuable, I would have preferred some better service.
"
"i am seriously OBSESSED with this band - i love everything about it! i‚Äôve had my eye on a wedding band like this forever, but big box stores don‚Äôt have many of this style and charge WAY more. this shop offers this in many sizes and colors and it‚Äôs exactly what i was looking for. it goes perfectly with my engagement ring (about 1 carat if anyone is curious for related sizing). i was between 1.8mm and 1.5mm band but i‚Äôm glad i went with the larger size because it is perfectly dainty against my other ring. gagik was  incredibly responsive and accommodating and even engraved my band for free. i will definitely order from this shop again
"
"so pretty!! i got the libra one and it's suck good quality, also my order only came in 5 days! it doesn't break when you adjust it, which is awesome. i love this ring
"
"I love how it looks! It doesn‚Äôt turn your finger green and is adjustable! It also came sooner than expected and the packaging is adorable! It‚Äôs a little bulgy but that‚Äôs how I like rings anyway!
"
"came so fast and i‚Äôm getting so many compliments on my ring!! love i!!
"
"I love this ring! I had been looking for a simple zodiac ring, so when I found this I knew I had to buy it! Bonus points for it not turning my finger green! It came fast and the package was small and cute!
"
 
 
 
 
"The ring is beautiful! The flowers aren‚Äôt as vibrant purple as in the pictures, but still great! I‚Äôm using this ring as my wedding ring when I get married in September! And the ring fit which is great!
"
"I am so happy with my ring! It is beautiful and I‚Äôm excited to own a piece of resin jewelry from Bea (the owner of this shop). Thank you for this amazing creation :)
"
"Wonderful! They are soooo beautiful! I'm in love üòç
"
"Simply beautiful. The ring looks exactly as pictured and fits perfectly, shipping was quick and issue-free, and even came with a couple (delicious) bonus goodies in the box. Thanks a bunch!
"
"I love this ring. It‚Äôs beautiful and dainty. It‚Äôs the perfect accent to my ring.

Thank you
"
"The ring was even more beautiful in person. Dainty with such exquisite detail. I'm in love to say the least.
"
"This band is it. 
 I have been searching for a band that would feel like mine, and I found it. It's just beautifully made and unique in its detail. I initially ordered too small of a size but was able to exchange, it was easy, and Emma was wonderful and accommodating. Emma, I don't just like it. I love it. Thank you so much.
"
"The rings are even MORE stunning in person, thank you so much for working with me on such a quick turnaround! Highly recommend this wonderful shop!
"
 
 
 
 
"They were perfect!
"
"These rings are perfect! They are simple, yet elegant. My engagement ring is always poking through my gloves at work, so these work great for me. My fiancee is a minimalist, and wanted something very simple. So happy with our purchase!

The seller was very easy to work with. My fiancee's ring was too big for him, and we had no issues with exchanging the ring for a different size with the seller.
"
"Great ring! Distinctive, durable, and lightweight. Adorable packaging too!

Plus, when I needed to change the size, he was happy to accept the exchange; all I had to do was pay the return shipping. Thanks Ian!
"
"Rings turned out amazing! They both fit great and they wear comfortably.
"
"These came out better than I thought! Based on reviews, I sized up on the rings and they fit perfectly. We even got a second set with a fun pattern! My Fiance and I lift weights, and my ring didn't budge or impose my workout. The inscription is very legible and says exactly what we wanted. Thank you!
"
"Absolutely love our rings! We even got a spare set for free! IN LOVE ü•∞
"
"Came as expected and in a timely manner. We got this for our 10 year anniversary. My Husband's a mechanic and I prefer a lighter ring. Husband's fits well. I ordered wrong size for myself so I will be back to order again. Definitely recommend.
"
"Our rings came quickly and exactly as specified! Caveman Bands even threw in an extra surprise for us! Thank you!!  Super happy with the rings :)
"
"I asked for a size 9 and ORDERED it and I still got a size 6.5.. I would like to get that size 9. I sent back the other ring. And I would like that ring ASAP. 

Thank you.
"
"Gorgeous ring!! Hefty, shiny and so good looking for such an amazing value!
"
"My boyfriend absolutely loves it! he nearly cried tears of joy! I loved the way it turned out! and I'm so so happy that the store owner messaged me making sure that the message was correct! thank you so much we love it!
"
"I loved this ring! Beautiful work, quick responses on any questions on concerns, and it shipped quickly. The font on the engraving is a nice touch. I cannot wait to give this as a gift.
"
"Love it so much!
"
"My daughter is a college student studying to be a Physician Assistant.  She absolutely loved the ring!  It was a Valentine gift.  I wrote in a card ‚ÄúSuccess is in your DNA‚Äù
"
"This is super cute and it fits well!
"
"Great customer service. Had to reach out to them regarding my order, they were fast and very professional. Thank you!
"
"The ring came in 4 days later, which was expected during this time. It came in a blue velvet pouch (not pictured). The color of the ring is darker than the picture shown. I preferred the darker color anyways. All in all great product and amazing quality.
"
"tr√®s bien, re√ßu dans les temps, bien prot√©g√©, couleur identique
"
"Love this ring it's really pretty, I wear it everyday:)
"
"Beautiful agate band.  Love the blue color!
"
"This band is gorgeous and understated and goes well with my engagement ring!
"
"So in love with this ring! It‚Äôs absolutely beautiful and looks amazing with my engagement ring (also purchased from Olive Ave.) Wonderful quality and fast shipping!
"
"Olive Avenue Jewelry did a phenomenal job on my wedding band! They were communicative and open throughout the whole buying process and delivered a gorgeous ring in the end. Their customer service is clear and open and I appreciated their attention to detail. A phenomenal jeweler to work with!
"
"Fast shipping and matches my engagement ring purchased from this shop as well. So pretty and dainty :)
"
"They are absolutely adorable. I got rings for me and my boyfriend and they are so cute. It only took a week for her to ship them a and 3-4 days to get to me (I'm in CA). Mine fits perfectly and I guessed his size but he wanted to wear it on a Chain anyways. We both are so happy with the product. Thank you so much for the excellent service and item.
"
"I was so impatient waiting for this ring but it is so pretty & worth the wait. The engraving is so clear & over all an awesome Treat Yo Self gift.
"
"Me and my boyfriend love our rings!
"
"Everything about my ring is incredible!  The engraving is perfect, the quality is perfect, the size is perfect...just completely PERFECT!!  Thank you so much!!
"
"I am obsessed with this ring! 
The style and quality is amazing. I just love it!
Even though I don't have small fingers the fit is nice (I wear 7.5-8 US ring size).
Shipping took just over 2 weeks to Virginia, USA and came nicely packaged.

Thank you again!
"
"What a beautiful ring! I was a little skeptical about how it might feel on my finger, as I've not had much luck with wider cuff rings before. This one is so well made, that it feels like a slim band would feel. It's incredibly comfortable! Also, the service is incredible. The seller is in Germany and I live in the States. It took only 10 days from date of purchase until the ring arrived. I will definitely order from this artist again. She's so talented, the jewelry is stunning, and the service is exceptional.
"
"I really want to give this 4.5 stars, because it's lovely, but I can't adjust the band. Maybe I'm just not strong enough? Also - the bark is very, very hard to see in my ring, unlike this photo. I expected it to be more of a noticeable contrast. That said, it's a quality piece of jewelry and it was on my wish list for a while, so I'm pleased to own it!
"
"This ring is beautiful!  Perfect for a nature lover and really does look like tree bark.  I am so happy I gave it a try.   It shipped very soon after I ordered it but took a long time to get to me from Germany...a couple of weeks.  It hopped around customs for a week or so.  I would say it is worth the wait though.  I will definitely trust this artist/vendor again.  Wearing it now as I write this.  You won't be sorry.
"
"Get in on this while you still can. I wear a size 13. This ring is very thick. The pictures don't do justice to the beauty of this ring. I've received several compliments on it. The painting really highlights the details.  This is my second ring from these folks. They have always been on time with a fantastic product. The sizing has been spot on. I just can't say enough about how satisfied I am.
"
"Very happy with my ring. The fit is perfect and the quality is unmatched. This is my first ring from coin crafters and I love it. I have purchased the same ring from 2 other companies and this is by far better quality and a better value. Thanks I will be purchasing more rings in the future.
"
"Ring is fantastic!  I had previously purchased a coin ring from another maker online.  It was pretty nice, but a little lightweight.  This one, with the black powder coat is much better than the one from the other maker.  I ordered a size 12, and was afraid it would be lightweight due to the size, but it is nice and heavy, but not too heavy.  The design and craftsmanship are both excellent.  It's beautiful and I love wearing it. Have received several compliments. The black background really makes the lettering and images stand out very well.  Thanks!
"
"True to size. It's a beautiful ring. My future husband is going to love it! He's always wanted a coin ring.
"
"It is beautiful and simple and lightweight; I can hardly tell I'm even wearing it.  I got the 2mm size in a 6 1/2 (my size) and it fits perfectly.  I wanted it for my wedding band, but my engagement ring is kind of an odd shape so won't quite work.  But, I'm completely fine with it because now I've got a gorgeous silver ring to wear all the time on another finger. 
The shipping was lightning fast and I appreciate that so much! The seller is very sweet and I want to buy again in the future!
"
"Simple and beautiful. I wanted a band to wear while working because my engagement ring and wedding band are attached. I love it!
"
"I absolutely love this hammered band.  It fits beautifully with my engagement ring.
"
"Such a unique and cool ring! I got the thinnest one as my husband's anniversary ring and it pairs so well with his large black wedding band. This ring would be so great for so many uses!
"
"My husband just love it. He's extremely happy with the ring, the way it fits and the way it looks. Thank you so much. And I, well, I couldn't be happier with my purchase, worth the wait, that was shorter than I expected, and of course the price.
"
"I bought this as an engagement ring for my fianc√© and he loved it! First off ordering was very easy. I wanted a 4 mm width and my fianc√© was in-between sizes and the seller was able to help with ordering as well as help with expediting. Initially my fianc√© said he wasn't wearing a ring but he's been wearing it since! Would def. recommend. Great craftsmanship.
"
"This is the band for my upcoming wedding. I love the fact that the material doesn't shrink or expand as dramatically as metal, making it easy to take off and put on in the mornings. The simple black textured finish goes with every outfit and matches my own personal style.

It's so lightweight too. The first thing I did when it came in the mail was play guitar with it to make sure it would't be too uncomfortable. In fact, it was so comfortable, I almost forgot I was wearing it.

The only thing I'd recommend is giving yourself lots of time when ordering this. Marc has a high volume, and while he is great with communication (he actually told me when he was making the ring and shipping), he's still a small operation making a high-quality product.
"
"I love it! Being carbon fiber, it‚Äôs so light and feels quite sturdy. It took me some time to find a small carbon fiber ring that will match my fianc√©‚Äôs wedding band.
"
"Thank you Alex for another absolutely breathtaking ring. I cannot wait until our wedding so I could put this ring on my finger. It is gorgeous, arrived quickly, and is just so beautiful. If anyone is looking for a unique wedding band or just a gift to give to their loved one, you will not be disappointed with this ring. Impeccable craftmanship and such an awesome shop owner. Thank you again.
"
"I got this as a replacement wedding band for my husband. We love it so much. It's a beautiful and totally unique piece and it shipped much faster than I expected. Couldn't be happier! Thank you!
"
"I am IN LOVE with this ring! I got it for my boyfriends as a promise ring and he also loved it. Super great quality!
"
"Beautiful ring. Ordered for my hubby after our daughter was born (Olivia, for the meaning.. Latin for Olive Tree/wood). Shipped quickly! Ordered a size too small and asked about an exchange with a quick response and turn around time. My husband loves it! Thank you!
"
"It's awesome üëå
"
"The ring is beatiful, very well done and i love it!!! thx you so much for the support via e-mail
"
"Absolutely love took me a minute to figure out how to adjust the ring but it‚Äôs everything I expected
"
"Lovely ring!! I cant believe how much detail it is able to have
"
"I love this ring. I got the garnet stone and it is gorgeous! Just what I was looking for. The fit is perfect and it is so beautiful. I might need to buy a few more!
"
"ARRIVED: My ring  arrived 5/20/2021 just as I expected. Looks just like the picture. I did a terrible job with sizing so I will have to adjust it. But, I love it!!!! I will order again! And know that it will get to me in due time. :0)
‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî-

I will update this review once my order arrives. I ordered this April 13th the pandemic has affected shipping. This review is only for shipping for those who want their jewelry fast. Don‚Äôt be disappointed. The ring may come one day and be gorgeous. So if you can wait while India is going through things please do. Vendor was very responsive but somethings are out of their control. My shipment has not moved yet. But, hopefully worth the wait.
"
"I‚Äôm in love with this ring. Chunky but lightweight! Thank you so much!
"
"So happy!  The ring is absolutely beautiful.  I could not be more happy.  I I wish it came with other stone options, I would buy them all!

"Fast delivery and ok quality

"i love my rings. i bought 2 different sizes.  The stone is so pretty and they haven't turned my finger green. the shipping was less than 1 week. i would definitely buy from them again.
"
"Loved it! My ring was even prettier in person. Picture didn't do it justice!
"
"love the size of the ring. I had ordered this one because I couldn't find my other opal ring. I love this ring!
"
"This ring is absolutely gorgeous. I got the wrong size, but I‚Äôm so in love with it and definitely recommend to others.
"
"I love this ring! It is way smaller than it looks in the picture but I already knew that from reading the description. Shipping was way faster than I expected! I can‚Äôt wait to buy more and stack them.
"
"Beautiful ring!  The rose gold is a perfect addition to my platinum and gold stack.  Shipping was AMAZINGLY fast considering it came from Greece.  Also, came in a beautiful box!
"
"I love them! They are absolutely beautiful and complement my wedding band! It was surprised at how quickly they arrived given that it is coming from Greece but there was no hiccups at all. Would definitely shop here again.
"
"The ring is even more beautiful in person.  the quality of the workmanship is impressive.
Customer service was was great and delivery was fast.  I couldn‚Äôt be happier.  I do think these rings are addicting and I will be buying more:)
"
"Tr√®s bon service et √©changes agr√©ables avec l'artiste. La bague est magnifique, imposante et lourde comme j'aime.
"
"I absolutely love my necklace. It is so beautifully detailed, the silver is very substantial and the craftsmanship is wonderful. Such a unique piece. The shop owner and artist is Dianne and she is such a joy to work with. She was so professional, helpful, kind and went above and beyond to help me achieve the finished piece I truly desired. Her personal touches along the way such as sending me pictures of my piece during its creation, through the end when I received my necklace in lovely packaging with a personal note. I look forward to owning other pieces from her in the future. Truly a wonderful experience all around, I highly recommend her and her beautiful jewelry. -Andrea
"
"Im over the moon about this ring. It will be my wedding ring in March. Dianne is so kind and accomodating. The ring is even more beautiful in real life and the quality is amazing. Will submit photo in March :)
"
"I absolutely love this ring.
It's beautifully made and is so comfortable to wear. It's been a pleasure buying from Dianne, she is so talented and  creative.
"
"My husband got me a RongRing3 for my engagement ring and I absolutely love it. He wanted one for his wedding ring but was afraid the 3 would be too thin for his fingers so we went with a 4. It looks amazing, matches mine, and we love the uniqueness of our wedding bands. Couldn't be happier with this shop or with these rings!
"
"My partner and I bought these for our anniversary, they fit perfectly and are just as beautiful as the photo. Thanks so much!
"
"I absolutely adore this ring. It is beautifully made and doubles up as a functional, albeit slightly fragile (because I bought it in silver and is prone to scratches) toy. Once I got the hang of it, dismantling and fixing the puzzle back together is so easy and elicits lots of gasps and amazement from my family and friends. 

Jeff, the seller, provides great service. Delivery was quick (from Thailand to SIngapore at least) and I received it about 5 days before the estimated delivery date. Highly recommend it for anyone looking for a simple yet unique band ring.
"
"Thanks, Jeff, for answering all my questions and helping me with my order. The ring we received is gorgeous and, despite lots of parts (it's a puzzle ring, after all) everything fits together beautifully! It will be the perfect gift!
"
"This is my favorite ring. It looks so much better on than alone in the picture. Buying more rings from this company.
"
"Love it
"
"Really cute.
"
"Arrived faster than I was expecting, lovely packaging, and the ring is high quality and very beautiful. Thank you!
"
"Very nice. I have bands from wood to titanium to tungsten to gold and this ceramic ring is one of my favorites. Go 10mm and half size up.
"
"I LOVE THIS RING!!! It‚Äôs absolutely beautiful. I‚Äôm all for everything white and whenever I don‚Äôt want to wear my engagement rock, I have this one as back up. It‚Äôs pearly white and just stunning. Shipping was extremely fast and im very happy with it!
"
"Super happy, got this in both white and black as our wedding bands. I have allergies to many metals, so these rings are perfect. They are super comfortable and I barely notice I'm wearing it. I have received many compliments on the striking pop of the white, so know it is not just me that thinks it looks fabulous. Thanks so much!
"
"It compliments my engagement ring perfectly and its beautifully crafted.
"
"We purchased two identical rings in two different sizes. We were looking for simple items with a minimal design and are very satisfied so far! 
The rings arrived a couple days later than expected but this may depend on the shipping service. 
The quality is high and the rings are slightly adjustable (both of them were a little loose, so you may want to go for a smaller size). The workmanship is very good, the material feels nice on the skin and becomes shinier and shinier.
We were so excited about our purchase and our expectations were not disappointed. Thanks to Lenka for her great job, we might as well purchase more items in the future.
"
"This is an amazing minimalist Ring. I enjoy it very much. Because it is slim and reduced to each bare minimum. But still looks rare and strange enough to be special. Would def buy again. *****
"
"Looks great, I love the minimal feel to it. I got it as a very simple engagement band and I'll definitely keep wearing it after I get hitched. Thanks so much!
"
"It took forever to get only because of customs but it was worth the wait! My husband loves it as a six year anniversary gift. I thinking about ordering me one because I really love the way it looks!
"
"Took a long time to get here, but they look amazing, ordered all 4 for me and my best friends, they all came out looking amazing, and I think it was an accident but they sent me a second Leo ring too, thanks so much guys!
"
"Took a while to get here but worth the wait! I got the wolf ring for my boyfriend as a surprise and the dragon ring for myself. The detail in each ring is stunning they look even better than I had hoped. They also feel very sturdy.
"
"I purchased the Wolf ring for my 17 year old son, who is a huge Souls fan and he loves it. The ring is more substantial than I expected and well made.  This looks and feels like a nice piece of jewelry.  As others have noted, shipping does take a while, but I knew this when I ordered and it was worth the wait.  I will be looking to order other pieces in this collection.
"
"My ring arrived quickly and unexpectedly to be honest. I am very happy with it. The craftsmanship is excellent and it looks nice and sturdy. The detail of the ring head is a little lighter than in the picture, but nothing to worry about, it's a wonderful piece all the same.
    
Thank you for a reasonably priced, quality replica, of this ring! The first one of seen so far, I hope you do more Dark Souls replicas! I would love to add to my collection!
"
"Ring is perfect! It is so polished, with literally zero imperfections. My son loves it! Shipping was average. Not too long and not super quick. Totally happy with my purchase. Thanks!
"
"We had a special request.  
Shir was excellent with all communications.

The craftsmanship & quality exceeded our expectations.

We are so pleased with the outcome & we highly recommend Magic Touch Art.
"
"this ring is BEAUTIFUL!!! i ordered an 8 but it felt a little too small but it‚Äôs also the middle of the summer so my fingers are naturally swollen but the ring itself is perfect and the service/company was awesome!
"
"I purchased this as a graduation ring and it is absolutely gorgeous. The lettering is beautiful and the special engraving I requested on the inside came out perfect. Every time I look at this ring on my finger, it brings me great joy. I will treasure it for the rest of my life. Thank you so much for your amazing work!
"
 
"Love them, absolutely perfect and better in real life than the picture <3 xx
"
 
"Seller was so lovely and helpful
"
"Gorgeous
"
"Bought one. Lost it in a move. Bought another. Beautiful.
"
"The ring is beautiful and sized perfectly
"
"Thank you for my ring. Ordering more for my family for Eid
"
"The ring took a very long time to get here, about a month but it fits great, other rings that I've ordered that have been from anywhere but the US have been way too small and untrue to size, but this one fits perfectly! The quality is great it looks just like the picture and the customer service I recieved was fantastic! Definitely recommend :)
"
"Just as pictured, heavy and nice. I got it to wear on my pointer finger and I love it!
"
"BEAUTIFUL ITS 

BIG AND UNIQUE
"
"I love this ring it is very distinctive and very well made.
"
"Ben, it‚Äôs absolutely stunning! I love wearing it and can‚Äôt quit staring at it. The moonstone you chose for my ring is so unique. I‚Äôve never seen an actual rainbow across a stone before. It‚Äôs just perfect. Thank you so much for your attention to the details. You are truly a great artist and I‚Äôm grateful I found you. I searched for 27 years for my perfect wedding ring. And this one I must say, was well worth the wait. Thank you! üíôüåà
"
"I am very pleased with my engraving. The feedback and customer attentiveness provided was top notch!
"
"Exactly what I wanted and how I wanted it - Ben put the icing on the cake with the beautiful engraving he performed on the ring!
"
"The custom engraving turned out beautifully - a really lovely way to make a piece stand out. Ben was very helpful throughout the entire process of the decision-making and purchase.
"
"I love this ring!  I bought it large enough to wear on my thumb while I video making my jewelry.  Thank you for the beautiful design!!!
"
"So happy with the ring and the delivery was SO FAST!! It only took 2 weeks I was expecting to wait a month!
"
"Eventhough it is a wide band it is slim and fits perfectly.  Not bulky at all.  Love It! Only disappoint was the wait time but worth it.
"
"I am literally fascinated - this is the most beautiful ring I ever bought. Fits perfectly, amazing quality and very fast shipping! I'm glad I got it while on sale, but I would've totally paid the full price on it. I am definitely going to buy again! I'm very happy with my order!!
"
"Unbelievably beautiful. So exquisite and perfect. Fits my personality and style so well. I have gotten so many compliments on it.
"
"Ordered April 21. Shipped May 7. Still haven‚Äôt gotten the ring.. starting to wonder if i got ripped off. 
The shop owners started out WONDERFUL and have messaged with me back and forth! Very kind. but has been slower with replies since they shipped the ring. 
Will update review if/when the ring shows up. Hope it does considering the money spent. ü•¥

UPDATE UPDATE UPDATE 5/24/2021: I got my ring! It‚Äôs a smidge big (ordered 4.5, i have baby fingers) it looks different colors in the light!! I opened it outside and it looked green. Took photo with the flash inside and it looks exactly as pictured! The owners have been SO helpful and amazing with communicating with me. USPS was the reason for the delay. They even have shipped a gift ring because of the issues I‚Äôve had. üñ§üñ§üñ§üñ§üñ§ thank you all.
"
"My ring is gorgeous!! I can't wait to use it as my wedding ring while traveling. Great communication from the seller, and it shipped even earlier than expected!
"
"Simply gorgeous! üòä The seller kept in constant contact with me throughout the entire process. Was surprisingly speedy, beautiful box. Love it! ‚ù§Ô∏è  Outstanding job guys, truly!! Thank you so much!
"

"I love it! It is perfect. The size is true. Sometimes when I order a ring with my size and it arrives, it is way too small.   This lovely ring fits my pinky so comfortably... I've already gotten ""love it"" comments.  I would definitely order from this seller again.

"Shipping updates took a little longer than I excepted, but I‚Äôm not super surprised with COVID shutting everything down for some time. Ring came looking as beautiful as the picture!! So happy with it! ‚ô•Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏è
"
"Prettiest ring! Can‚Äôt take it off my hand!!
"
"LOVE! Just recieved my ring yesterday it isn't too big and is even more beautiful in person. Highly recommend !!
"
"I love this ring I got it because it reminded me of my Granny‚Äôs wedding band I love how I can wear It as a thumb ring or as a regular ring I think it‚Äôs very beautiful I will say though it did take some time to get here but that‚Äôs because of two things it‚Äôs coming from Australia and with COVID-19 that has slowed everything down in the mail but I would definitely recommend it or purchase it again it just takes time to get here
"
"Such a Beautiful Ring. I got the wrong size so neither for on my thumb. But they still make for great rings on my other fingers. Beautifully Unique!
"
"The shipping took a little bit of time (which makes sense, it‚Äôs from Australia lol) this ring is beautiful!! It‚Äôs my new favorite ring!! Stunning job!
"
"Exactly what I was looking for! It is the perfect fit and so smooth. It goes perfectly with my silver stacking rings!
"
"Very pretty ring!  I asked for it to be left more on the matte side, and I think it looks very cool!  Ring kind of glows.
"
"This ring is beautiful-- just what I wanted. Thanks so much for shipping it so quickly.
"
"This ring is beautifully hand hammered. Just love it!
"
"Very nice ring. I real the ring looks more polished/shiny than on the picture.
"
"This little owl couldn't be any cuter. I love wearing this comfortable ring and looking at this adorable little guy. The coin is in amazing condition having great detail and a good size and shape. The gold bezel and band really set off the silver coin and add to the beauty of this ring. I've waited a long time for my perfect owl ring, and this is it! I couldn't be happier with my purchase. You're the best, Mara!
"
"Beautiful ring! As always everything I have purchased from Mara is gorgeous.The coin in this ring is in amazing condition and the diamonds have a dreamy shimmer. Thank you Mara for the extra twinkle on the band. Love it all.
"
"Love my bunny...thanx, MJ..oxvz
"
"This is such a fabulous coin! It has a perfect and spectacular dark patina on the silver that shows off the Gorgon's face just beautifully. The little diamonds on each side of the coin are so bright and sparky and the gold is thick and very well made. I wear her on my pinky finger and she looks fabulous. I highly recommend this amazing artist and her wonderful shop. I have several pieces from her and my collection is growing. Thank you so much! Perfect in every way!
"
"I‚Äôm obsessed, I need more colors ASAP! & shipping was so fast! ü•∞

"I went all out and got labradorite earrings, rings, and necklace!
I can‚Äôt say how much I love the designs and quality of cila! 
This is my 2nd ring and I think I‚Äôm in love!
"
"I LOVE THIS RING SO MUCH!!! I've had it for a little over a month now and have worn it practically every day. It has held up very well! Shipping was so quick, it arrived so much faster than I imagined. I will definitely be shopping with this seller again. Thanks for a beautiful ring!!
"
"I absolutely love this ring. The color of the labradorite stone is stunning and it looks wonderful when worn.  It's delicate, and beautiful even to the smallest detail. The only negative point was i had to pay almost 80% of the value of the ring in customs fees on reception to Switzerland. Nevertheless would order here again!
"
"I love the ring! It's beautiful!
I have a huge problem with buying rings as my fingers are very small but I was able to adjust this one and it fit perfectly.
"
"So lovely.  Get many compliments.  Thank you for the quick shipping and perfect little ring!!
"
"This is a gorgeous ring . looks much better in real life than on website . Well done and excellent service from JuJu .
"
"A beautiful ring, my girlfriend loves it! And the seller was very good at quickly replying to any queries I had! 10/10 would buy again
"
 
"I love it so much, it is beautiful!
"
"Absolutely gorgeous ring. Very happy with my purchase. Thank you so much!
"
"I ordered .25 up in size, as recommended and it‚Äôs literally a perfect fit! Great product, thanks so much!

"Lovett is ring!
"
"I just received my ring and I love it! I was looking for another moonstone ring to replace my previous teardrop moonstone ring that I misplaced. Hopefully it will pop up somewhere one day. What I like most about this ring the blue adularescent effect. Knowing that it depends on the part of the stone that's cut, I didn't have that with my last ring. The stone is bigger than my last and a little more elegant although my last was as well. It was just sat high as it was a poison ring. The pricing is amazing. I even have an engraving on the back of the band that can serve as a reminder everytime I wear it. The owner provided quick and awesome customer service in assisting me and answering my questions. He messaged when there was an update or change and wished a happy holiday. My ring arrived sooner than expected.
"
"Beautiful ring!! Due to covid delaying shipping and it being Christmas season and that delays shipping as well it took a couple more days to get here, but the second I looked at the ring it was all worth it!! It‚Äôs gorgeous and perfect and I‚Äôm in love!!
"
"Came super quick! Love this ring! Beautiful and simple.
"
"I was hesitant because:
1) This seller has only 1 review. I don't like to be the one to test something out. I usually only purchase something that has a ton of reviews, but, I thought, this is a small seller, and they're new--I'll try them out.
2) I've never purchased from outside the US. If I have a problem, will it be hard to resolve or communicate? I even did a reverse image search on the seller's profile image, just to see if it popped up. Couldn't find it anywhere. Seems legit.

EXPECTATIONS EXCEEDED! This ring is gorgeous! True to picture and true to size! The wood, colors, edges, cut--it's smooth, polished, and beautiful! And, as the other review mentions, it came in a really cute wooden box. Also, while purchasing, I asked the seller questions, and they replied quickly, and were very helpful and nice.
"
"I absolutely Love this ring! The cosmic energy in this piece is powerful! The way the sunlight catches through it is so stunning.. the fit is perfect and comfortable. I've worn this ring everyday since it arrived...
"
"Perfect present. You may choose 1 size upper the real finger size.
It is the 2nd ring I buy here and the jewel are beautiful, the seller is really cool too!
"
"This is such a beautiful ring. It's a very different shape to most of the resin wood rings that you can buy and this one stands out a lot. The colours are beautiful and it looks amazing when it's on. I absolutely love it.
"
"Love this ring! it‚Äôs dainty and everything I was looking for. Well done üëçüèº
"
"Got my ring today and absolutely love it! It's sized correctly and beautiful. It's petite and I can wear it casually or for a night out. The stone just sparkles! Thank you!
"
"Absolutely love the rose gold ring. It got a size 7. And it fits perfectly. Simple yet elegant. I wear it everyday!
"
"Der Ring ist sehr zierlich und wundersch√∂n gearbeitet :) ich habe schon lange nach so einem tollen Ring gesucht! Er ist sehr schick und passt zu jedem allt√§glichen Outfit. :) kann ich nur weiterempfehlen! Der Versand war schnell und der Ring super gut verpackt! Danke.
"
"Very light weight.  The ring consists of two connected parts, poor quality for the money.  I am disappointed!!!!
"
"I absolutely love my ring. I'm incredibly happy with the quality, this feels like a sturdy/wearable/durable ring.
"
"BEAUTIFUL! I‚Äôm in love ! Thank you so much. Shipping was actually faster than I expected. 10/10
"
"Everything about this order was perfect and exceeded my expectations. The designer, Alon, communicated with me me throughout the process and even helped me make some adjustments and very personalized piece. 

The necklace arrived yesterday and it‚Äôs gorgeous! Exactly what I wanted. The chain  is stunning and the letters are tiny and exactly the size I wanted. The piece is so fine and just beautiful. I‚Äôm so happy! And with the express shipping it arrived in less than a week from Israel to NY.  

Thank you so much Alon! I love it!
"
"I absolutely love this ring!!! The color is amazing! It truly is beautiful and it came so quickly I was nicely surprised! Thank you so very much!

"
"This ring looks beautiful in person, easy to adjust the size too!
"
"I am in love with this ring. I bought it to replace a similar ring I had but broke and I couldn‚Äôt be happier. It‚Äôs absolutely beautiful and fits perfectly. I wish I had 100 fingers so I could wear 100 of these rings
"
"Bad lighting, but I LOVE it! Promise ring for my boyfriend. Took exactly a month to get here (USA), but it‚Äôs well worth the wait!
"
"These rings are so beautiful I couldn't choose just one! Fast shipping, considering where they came from. I've only had them a few days and have had so many compliments! The flowers are even brighter in person.
"
"My ring arrived in a timely manner and was packaged in the cutest box.    The ring is beautiful.   You can see the details of the flowers and ferns at a distance so you know that it is well made.    This has become my right hand favorite already!    Definitely would go back to their site for future purchases!
"
"I bought this ring as a promise ring for myself after a really tough breakup. Green is my favorite color and peridot is my birthstone so it holds a lot of personal value to me. Overall the ring is stunning. It‚Äôs dainty, it‚Äôs delicate, it‚Äôs beautiful, and it‚Äôs super easy to wear everyday. Overall I‚Äôm extremely satisfied with my new ring and might end up buying more from here in the future. :)
"
"I am so in love with this peridot ring!!! It‚Äôs so dainty but durable. It‚Äôs beautiful. The shipping was quick and the quality is on point. I‚Äôm very pleased with this purchase.
"
"Beautiful ring, peridot fell out after 7 days. Simon is a very communicative seller and sending me a new one.
"
"It looks even more beautiful in person than in the pictures! I love my new ring so much. Thank you!!
"
"I absolutely loveeee this ring!!!! It‚Äôs so beautiful I‚Äôm obsessed üòç
"
"I absolutely love this ring! It‚Äôs beautiful! I‚Äôd highly recommend this seller! The packaging was beautiful! Thanks for making this ring! Will go great with my Pandora star and moon bracelet!
"
"The quality is gorgeous! I was a little hesitate to widen the ring to fit my finger, but it's holding up nicely and does not look warped at all! 

The packing was so cute, I loved it. Thank you so much!
"
"absolutely beautiful! Better than I had anticipated, very happy with my new ring!
"
"I have to warn that the mail is moving slow. It took almost a month and a half to arrive..but I was pleasantly surprised. Very happy with my ring.. This ring was true to the pics. Real silver 
and larimar. Nice quality! I love it! Thank you!
"
"Love,Love, love this ring.  I mis ordered size and gave it to my picky 21 year old daughter. She is obsessed with it . Have purchased two more rings and cannot wait to receive them.
"
"This ring is STUNNING!!! Please please please buy it, you will not regret it! The picture is amazing, but It‚Äôs even better in real life. It‚Äôs very soothing and so pretty to look at!!
"
"I love this ring.  It fits perfectly which is hard to do buying a ring on line since I have small fingers.  I was unsure as to if I should try buying it but I'm so glad that I did.  It arrived quicker than they quoted it would.  I will definitely deal with this shop again.  They are really great to work with.

"Absolutely stunning and beautiful! So in love with the moonstone ring!! I even got a gift dream catcher necklace as a gift and that is gorgeous as well! It was all packaged carefully and arrived on time as expected! Absolutely in heaven with my purchase! Everything is gorgeous and i was so surprised i got a gift with my purchase. Im smiling ear to ear with how happy I am on my purchase!
"
"Absolutely beautiful! It‚Äôs so well made, but still feels delicate and light. I love it!! üòç
Thank you for the free gift, too! ü•∞
"
"Quick shipping and included a complimentary dream catcher necklace with my purchase. I love the leaves detail on the band. My only complaint is the moonstone has some scratches on it, unsure if the stone is naturally that way or if the scratch happened during shipping.
"
"Perfect! Love my ring! Thank you for the gift as well!
"
"my most favorite rings i own now, oh my goodness they are the cutest! the shipping was as it said in description, yeah i wish it was a little faster but it was so worth the wait and she was very sweet when contacting! also i got two free little crystals in my order and i can‚Äôt explain how sweet that is! i definitely recommend, especially for this great deal!!
"
"So pleased with my purchase! I bought two rings and both of them turned out so pretty. Even tho they are wire wrapped they are dainty and extremely pretty. She also included two tiny extra stones with my purchase and everything came in a very cute sachet. Will definitely purchase more in the future!
"
"I purchased one ring (smaller sized one with a Jade stone ) for my 12 year old daughter and a larger sized light peach colored stone for myself. The package arrived even earlier than expected! Huge relief with it being the Christmas season! The rings absolutely surpassed my expectations. They are both gorgeous. üíçüíçI loved the packaging and the bonus rock that somehow is a mixture of the color of the two stones. I will give it to my daughter. üíó I definitely plan on ordering some more items in the future for myself and friends and family. 5 stars for sure. üíçüíç‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê
"
"I absolutely love my rings. I got them today and I‚Äôm so excited to wear them. I got a size 10 and size 9 so I can wear on different fingers. It also came in a cute gift bag and had a cool stone! I will definitely shop again.
"
"Beautiful chunky ring - very well made
"
"Absolutely love my necklace. Wore it with my Easter outfit and received many compliments!
"
"I absolutely love this ring! It looks exactly as pictured and is really beautiful and unique. Extremely pleased with this purchase!!
"
"I bought these earrings and the matching ring as my first purchase from TomasCross shop.  I loved them so much, I went on to buy quite a few more earring and ring sets.  I love how these sets manage to be chic and edgy and not at all kitschy.  They are very well-made and the artwork is precise and distinct.  The jewelry aspect is sturdy.  I am always excited to wear these pieces!
"
"i love it & it looks even better in person.

"BELLE BAGUE REALISATION PARFAITE MERCI

"Lovely piece of nature to carry with you.

"Love this ring!! Great quality and shipped fast for being so far away.
"
"Beautiful ring! Love the design!
"
"j'adore ces bijoux qui sont juste tr√®s beaux
"
"It's fab, loads of my friends have admired it.
"
"This headpiece was absolutely perfect. Exactly what I was envisioning for my wedding day. I ended up ordering this very late and the package wasn't scheduled to arrive until after my wedding day, Marina worked with me to make sure it made it on time. Thanks to her, it came the day before the wedding!! So thankful she took the time to help and was incredibly sweet throughout the whole process. Couldn't be happier with this purchase!!
"
"Beautiful! Thank you so much for bringing a touch of glamour into my wedding :)
"
"I wore these flowers for my wedding and they were just perfect! Everybody loved them and they stayed in all night! I'd just recommend ordering them way ahead of time cuz they do take a few weeks to get to you but they're totally worth it!!
"
"Very sparkly! Surprisingly not very heavy. Love these earrings! They shipped within 3 weeks to Aus. Exactly as described. Wore them to my engagement party and got compliments all night!!
"
"It was perfect in every way; size, quality, and delivery time. I used a ring sizing app to chose the size ring and they were spot on.
"
"I love it!
"
"My ring is changing color already and I just got it
"
"I loved it! Hoping to buy a necklace next
"
"I just received my rings! I was pretty nervous ordering such a high dollar item on the internet but I will buy all of my jewelry from Lena at SevenCarat! The rings are absolutely stunning and everything I had hoped!
"
"Lena from sevencaratshop was incredibly helpful in helping me acquire this ring for my now fianc√©e. All of her jewelry looks great and is easy to find on her Etsy page. She had it sized and shipped halfway across the world in minimal time, I was able to propose much earlier than anticipated. The quality of the diamond is pristine, such an exquisite cut I even find myself taking closer looks at it! Of course she said yes, and now the only thing shining brighter than the ring is my gorgeous fianc√©es smile. She loves showing it off and it‚Äôs all thanks to Lena at sevencaratshop! I will be a repeat customer in the future for sure!
"
"Very fast shipping considering the ring came from Israel. I liked that the seller used Fedex vs the postal service.

The ring is gorgeous! It has incredible sparkle! It is difficult to believe this ring is just 1 carat as it looks like a 3 carat ring. I also like that the band of the ring gets slightly wider in the back. I‚Äôm very happy with my purchase! I‚Äôm wearing it as an anniversary ring.
"
"I can‚Äôt stop staring at my new engagement ring! Honestly it‚Äôs one of the prettiest rings I‚Äôve ever seen. My fianc√© is very proud of it and I‚Äôm a very happy fianc√©e. He says his favorite part is how much I love it. Lena was amazing and patient answering all our questions about fitting it with wedding bands we had from my grandma. She even gave us a little sneak video to help with our excitement (though to be honest it was all my excitement)!  Shipping was incredibly fast! I hear nothing but compliments when people notice my ring!
"
"What a gorgeous little owl! It looks so much nicer in real life too! It is a tad lighter than what I'm used to, but it really is a beautiful ring. It was also really lovely to open the padded envelope and find my ring in this quite beautiful gift box with a handwritten thank you note with my name on it, signed by Kay. A really thoughtful touch which put a smile on my face, thank you Kay! :) Delivery was quite fast also, from the US all the way to the land of Oz. When I ordered, Kay also sent a personal email to let me know that she was dispatching my order the next day. A personal, not an automated Etsy email. Again, all these thoughtful touches, plus a beautiful product, and I'm more than happy to purchase more from Kay's store, as well as to recommend her products and services highly! Thank you again Kay! :) Blessings to You.
"
"I. Love. This. Ring. It is beautifully crafted and is perfect for my pinky finger. But will fit most ring sizes. Please purchase from this seller. There items are remarkable. A+++
"
"Love it! I love owls. And I've been looking for a owl ring for while. It's hard for me to find a ring that fits me since I have such small fingers so this ring is perfect for me and I love the old fashion look of it too. Thank you so much.
"
"It is completely gorgeous; the edges are a little sharp but that's okay. It's so pretty and looks kinda old which I love. Not only that but the shop owner is so wonderful. The shipping was weird with the order and she got wind of it and sent another one because the first one failed to arrive. I would 100%  buy from this seller again because not only is the product gorgeous and exactly as I thought it would be, but the seller is so reasonable and so nice that I am happy to support them :)
"
"More beautiful in hand than in photo.  I was so happy to feel how light it is.
"
"I could NOT be any happier with my ring!!!! It was so worth the wait and I'm going to wear it every day! Thank you so much Michael, you are a true artist!!! I just love it!!!
"
"This is a really beautiful ring that's excellently made, but I would recommend getting the sterling silver add-on like I wish I had. I'm not sure if my water's really hard or something, but I wore this for a couple days, cleaned it with the cloth (which I love and used on my other rings as well), but the day after, it turned my finger green. I don't usually have problems with rings and all my other rings that I wear for days are fine, but I guess this did it. The item definitely exceeded my expectations in terms of quality and packaging, but some combo of my skin/city water didn't fit this ring, so now it's a really pretty art piece. It's awesome that the seller has the sterling silver as an option, I just wish I was smart enough to do it the first time. Maybe next year!
"
"Michael I am thrilled with the beautiful ring! Thank you so much for your ease of communication, quality product and pretty fast delivery considering I am in Australia...brilliant thank you, Sara
"
"I love this ring more every day! Arrived a day earlier than I expected, and it really should've been a longer wait, but it was rushed to me. Thank you, so much!
"
"I love this ring! When it first came in, the stone was a little bigger than what I was expecting. But I also have very tiny (almost child-sized) hands, so I really should not have been surprised that it looked bigger. After wearing it for about a week, I think it is the perfect size and steal glances at it all the time. I am already mulling over another future ring purchase!
"
"I have been looking at this ring for a while & decided to treat myself for my birthday. So glad I did!  This is even prettier in person. Definitely will be back for another piece!
"
"The ring is beautiful, My lady said she wanted a ring like this for our engagement ring. I haven't asked yet, but I like it. Teri was easy to work with, she replies quickly, the product came on time, and she helped me determine the size. Overall there is literally nothing I can complain about!
"
"So cute!! I have small hands so finding rings that fit well can be pretty difficult, but this ring fit perfect!! The packaging was also super cute!
"
"I love this ring so much, I already got some nice compliments about it! It arrived very fast ;)
"
"Wear it basically every day! Loveeee the way it looks with my other rings. It gets tons of compliments! :)  I also love the fact that you can size it to fit perfectly. Only ring I own that fits like a goddam glove. Thank you so much! 10/10 would buy again :)))
"
"Tr√®s belle bague malgr√© qu'elle soit un peu large pour mes petits doigts mais tr√®s sympa et originale, attention cependant a ce que les bouts des tentacules ne s'accrochent pas a vos cheveux ou vos v√™tements (je parle d'experience). Mais sinon je l'adore, la trouve confortable et fid√®le aux photos. Arriv√©e dans les temps
"
"SUPER FAST SHIPPING! the quality of this ring is amazing. It definitely has some weight to it which makes me feel so comfortable knowing it doesn‚Äôt
 look or feel cheap! The price was completely perfect! Thanks so much!
"
"My fianc√© loves this ring! We got him fitted for a comfort style ring at a jewelry store before ordering and the ring fit perfect!
"
"This ring is beautiful, my fianc√© loves it. The engraving turned out awesome and the look and feel of the ring really just can‚Äôt be beat!
"
"Was exactly what I was looking for. It is a good quality ring. I was going to get a name brand ring but I couldn‚Äôt engrave it like I wanted to. This ring I was able to put wedding date inside. Hubby can‚Äôt ever forget!
"
"I just received my ring and it was even prettier than I expected.   It is made very well.  I am very happy I was able to get this ring
"
"Love! Love! Love!  Beautiful ring and seller could not have been nicer!  My ring shipped within hours of ordering.
"
"Absolutely gorgeous, I‚Äôm obsessed with it. Thank you so much!! I absolutely will be ordering from you again soon. Super quick shipping and comes in an adorable box. Thank you so much!
"
"i‚Äôm in love with my ring and will be buying more!!
"
"Very pretty stone. It  is a bit bigger than I‚Äôd anticipated, and than I‚Äôd usually wear, but it‚Äôll be the perfect fun, casual summer ring. I wore it to the doctor‚Äôs office, and received a compliment on it, which is always unexpected and nice!  The lovely aqua color of this pretty quartz is reminiscent of the Pacific waters I saw once while visiting the Great Barrier Reef and Fitzroy Island area of NE Australia, and the faceting makes it catch the light nicely. I ordered a size  6 ring (my typical size), and it was a wee bit too big for my ring finger, (as is often the case), but I used a small piece of clear, coil-style ring spacer material, and it now sits perfectly and comfortably on my right hand. This isn‚Äôt a high-end artisan piece... it‚Äôs just fun costume jewelry, but it‚Äôs pretty, and the price can‚Äôt be beat!
"
"I love this ring!!!  It‚Äôs absolutely gorgeous and the customer service was amazing.  My one and only small gripe, is that this was advertised as aqua quartz and it‚Äôs actually aqua chalcedony.  Very stunning though!!
"
"I absolutely love my ring. It‚Äôs so beautiful
"
"The ring is just lovely. The weight of the stone and silver is heavy and nice. I ordered another in another color. Shipping takes a bit but they were quick to respond and ensure it‚Äôs expected delivery.
"
"So originally I was obsessed with the Tiffany&Co Paloma Picasso olive leaf ring. However, after going to Tiffany‚Äôs and trying it on... it didn‚Äôt quite spark joy.. plus it was 250 for sterling silver. I figured there‚Äôd be something similar on Etsy when I came across this ring. Let me just tell you, the photo does no justice. This ring is so beautiful and definitely sparks joy!! The only negative thing is that since I work with my hands a lot, it gets snagged onto things and it has cut up my finger. Even so, it is probably one of my favorite rings!!
"
"Very, very pretty ring and extremely fast shipping, from Turkey to Sweden in 24 hours?! ü§Ø Mind. Blown. I have only tried it on for a few minutes, but I feel the ring is well balanced, since it's thin on the underside so I almost can't feel it and am not restricted by it, but the top will stay in place even though it's heavier. Also very nice to receive it in a small bag and with a lovely box, like I went shopping for it irl.
"
"Love my new ring!!!! 
It‚Äôs high quality and delicate. It‚Äôs just what I was looking for!!
"
"This ring is so beautiful and elegant! Shipped quickly too - I will definitely buy from this shop again. üåüüåüüåüüåüüåü
"
"PERFECT! They look amazing! The fact that are adjustable is amazing x I definitely recommend them!
"
"They‚Äôre so cute and fit so well
"
"In love with these rings! So beautiful and look exactly as in the pictures !
"
"These rings are honestly amazing!!!
"
"The person was super friendly, i messed up the colors and she agreed to help! and change the bracelet size ! We love the product ! we bought 3 of them it's an amazing gift (my mom and my aunt loves them!!) I would 100% recommend this bracelet !!! It turns out beautiful and my mom never takes it off and it's in a perfect condition !!
"
"Stunning necklace with the gemstones. I selected express shipping but it still came in two days still from Turkey to the US, extremely fast.
"
"Absolutely perfect! Looks way better than I expected. Ships international but was so fast!
"
"The ring is beautiful!  The first  ring that was made was lost in shipping.  AniJewelry made another one right away and sent it out right away.  That one arrived and I love it!!!  Great people to work with!
"
"This ring has a very special symbolic meaning for me. The owl helped me on my healing journey with cancer last year so when I saw it I knew I must have it. Took a month because she makes each one on order. Worth waiting for. It fits perfectly, comfortable to wear and the sapphire eyes are a nice mid blue with sparkle rather than almost black like allot of small sapphires. 
Be aware the finish is brushed rather than high polish. I might have liked high polish on shank as well as beak and brow with brushed face. Regardless, it is a powerful and lovely ring that really captures the essence of ""owl"". Thankyou Elina. Blessings from Montana, Jaqui
"
"I love my barn owl ring with sapphire eyes. One of my favorite rings. I highly recommend this seller‚Äôs items.
"
"I received my owl ring on Tuesday this week.  It is absolutely beautiful, I love it!!! (Owls are my favorite animal) It looks even better in person and is definitely one of the best, if not the best thing I have ever bought myself.  It arrived in less than 2 weeks (to Australia) after being shipped on the 31 March - arrived much sooner than I expected and was a wonderful surprise to receive after a long day at work.  I will definitely be making further purchases from Elina again.  Thank you very much for my unique and beautiful ring Elina.
:-D
"
"I love owls and this ring is truly breathtaking. Such a simple design that captures an owl's amazing expression. The quality is outstanding. A really unique ring and it fits perfectly!
"
"Beautiful. I just received my ring today. The shop mailed out my ring immediately. Shipping took a few weeks from Spain, but it was well worth the wait. I highly recommend this seller. Thanks.
"
"This ring is absolutely beautiful!  I received it in just under two weeks.
"
"The deliver for this was amazingly fast! And the ring! The ring is absolutely gorgeous! I have gotten so many compliments while wearing it! I would recommend this store to anyone looking for beautiful jewelry! 10/10 Will shop here again!
"
"Lovely
"
"This ring is super cute and a great price!  Arrived quickly in cute packaging with instructions on proper use.  I wore it every day for about 2 weeks, and now wear it intermittently.  Just a few things I would note: 1) I would have been willing to pay more to make this a non-adjustable band. I get fiddly with my rings and found myself constantly tightening and loosening it, and sometimes when I do a manual activity it pinches the back of my finger. Would be a nice option to add in the future. 2) As the instructions note, it needs a little extra caution if you want to keep it in the best of shape.  I ran around with it pretty recklessly and noticed a few minor scratches. Still looks great though. 3) The Asian side looks a little squished due to the height of the band. I still like it but wouldn't mind it being taller.

"I thought this was taking a long time to arrive so I contacted the seller. She replied immediately with tracking information! I didn‚Äôt realize it was coming from Greece. I received it the following day (one week). The ring is beautiful and looks exactly as pictured. I highly recommend this seller.
"
"I love this ring! I got the sterling silver version. The design is beautiful and just as pictured. I love to travel, and most recently wore it on a trip around Budapest Hungary. The ring held up great, even in the thermal baths!  Now every time I look at it, it reminds me of all the places I‚Äôve been and all the places I‚Äôve yet to go.
"
"I love this adventurous ring its very well made great for my wide fingers. The design is beautiful. I do personally wish I would have picked the rose gold, brass tends to leave a green mark but that's alright üòä I love this ring thank you!!
"
"This ring is not only beautiful, but magical also. Not only did it help me through one of the more trying days of my life, but I also miraculously qualified for financing for a new car-a one in a trillion chance with my credit history. Honestly, the ring is healing and, for me, is truly meaningful. Looking at the Mandala design calmed me throughout the day. How can I describe it? The ring just felt ""right"" for me. Thank you for crafting the Moon Mandala ring.  Excellent shipping time and seller communication, too! Highly recommend!
"
"I have received this beautiful piece of art and I love it.
Putting it on in the morning puts a smile on my face and I watching it gives me good vibes.
It fits perfectly and I am really happy to have purchased it.
I definitely recommend this beautiful store!
Thank you Rita and Miguel, keep up with making these amazing jewellery :)
"
"so pretty and packed with lots of love and thoughtfulness. the owners wrote a little uplifting handwritten note on top of it being packaged super adorable with little extra sparkle. Just so happy and caring. I love it my ring and I know it was made with lots of love and smiles. thank you ! the small things in life that make all the difference. I lost my grandpa the day it arrived very early and for that it's even more special and turely my heeling jewle. muah! everyone needs their own special medalia. thanks a bunch. this gal is all smiles. wonderful business and very personal. love love love it. I will forever cherish the moment and colorful nugget.
"
"This Beautiful ring took the long way from Portugal to my finger here in Pennsylvania!  My parcel arrived today & I could not be any happier than I am right now, as my new ring adorns my finger with a fit that is perfect!  I never worried for a moment when my purchase took its time to reach me, the seller made contact with me often to assure me that all would be well üíú They were right! My ring was shipped in a very secure fashion with a small gift included, both surrounded by stars‚ú≠‚ú≠‚ú≠‚ú≠‚ú≠ Thank you, everything is lovely üíü
"
"I already receive so many compliments on this ring!  One thing I really like is that the filigreed band is more delicate and detailed in person than in the photos.  This also utilizes a better moon image than many other similar moon rings on Etsy.  Took a long time to arrive from Lithuania, but that's not a big deal really.  It was a fun surprise the day it finally arrived!
"
"The ring is beautiful!!! It says it is made to fit anyone but it doesn‚Äôt fit me well and it pinches me. I wear a size 7/8 ring. I just wish the part around your finger was longer so it fit better. I would buy them all lol
"
"I really love your jewelry, it's so beautiful and made with so much love !!!! Thank you so much, I'm so happy with my new rings and necklace üòç
"
"This ring is radical! It makes the wearer look like some sort of wizardry major. And it came in a little box made of dead tree (super cute), and sitting on a bed of smaller, thinner strips of dead tree WITHIN SAID DEAD TREE BOX! It really adds to the general mind-blinding going on with this ring. 
It took a long time to ship, (5 weeks) but I think that's on Canada Post, not the seller. 
All in all a winning purchase for winning winners!
"
"Beautiful ring!
"
"This is a well-made and quite lovely ring.  The colors are exactly as depicted.  It stands about 1/2"" or 15cm above my finger, which is larger than I expected, and which makes this an elegant architectural statement for your hand.  Arrived in a timely fashion and well packaged.  VERY pleased with purchase and communication with seller.
"
"I was hoping it would be more colorful and aqua color like the picture. The packaging is beautiful.
"
 
"Absolutely beautiful. As my grandmother passed away we sang John Denver's ""Rocky Mountain High"" together, and I wanted to be able to carry that final memory with me. The ring is clearly handmade and it's absolutely perfect. It's a little more than I usually pay for my jewelry, but well worth it. I'll definitely be back!
"
"I LOVE this gorgeous ring. It is more beautiful worn than seen on the phone screen. It is truly a beautiful piece of art and I'm so proofs to wear this. Others don't even come close with this ring. I'm in love!!!!! Thank you
"
"I absolutely love it - the corners don't poke my hand and I was concerned about that.  Perfect!
"
"Absolutely beautiful! The quality is awesome! 
I was also in a crunch for time and they shipped it expedited shipping and I received it within 5 days. 
I will definitely be ordering again.
"
"Absolutely in love with the ring I ordered! Shipping was faster than I expected considering it came from Turkey and I'm in South Carolina. You cannot beat the price either! Will definitely be ordering more in the future!
"
"I absolutely love these rings. The snake one is my favorite!!!! LOVE LOVE LOVE üíï üíïüíïüíïüíïüíïüíïüíïüíïüíïüíïüíïüíï
"
"I‚Äôm happy with my purchase. The ring is made well and looks exactly like the picture. I will buy again!
"
"Such a pretty ring! It is quite large but I love that about it; it really allows you to see all of the designs on the ring!
"
"Beautiful and unique ring!! I‚Äôm from the US so it took a bit long to get here but it was totally worth the wait!!
"
"Beautifully done! Usually pieces like this come out smaller than they look but this one covers a good portion of my finger and is so pretty üòç ship time was a wait! But well worth it.
"
"It is so gorgeous! The beads are beautiful and have several pretty colors that you can see as the bead turns. The ring is very comfortable to wear and there are no sharp spots that scratch or snag clothing. This ring took a while to arrive but it is handmade and came from the other side of the world so I‚Äôd say it was worth the wait!
"
"Love the ring I received!! I wish that the shipping didn‚Äôt take so long, but it is worth the wait- will definitely order more!! The rating is simply because of the response rate from the seller, but other than that, I am very pleased!!
"
"I adore this ring! I love how dainty it is, yet how beautifully vibrant the turquoise is. I wear it everyday and have gotten so many compliments!
"
"I love Kara's jewelry. This is my 2nd time purchasing and customer service is always stellar. The color of the Turquoise Ring is vivid and overall the ring is stunning.
"
"Love it
Thank you!
"
"Looks exactly as pictured. Its so hard for me to find larger sized rings, so I was more than thrilled when I found this shop. Thank you!
"
"Arrived super swift!  The pictures don't capture the true beauty of this ring.  I was overwhelmed & astonished speechless by the shere beauty & master craftsmanship of this ring.  The details are so intricate that only the human eye can really perceive it. Additionally, it was carefully wrapped & placed within a lovely silver pouch, which was placed within a most beautifully gold box, accompanied with a polishing cloth, business card  & a most gracious thank you card (within an envelope) & a hand written thank you message from Joe!!!  -- Who is this guy? -- This is STELLAR customer care!!!  It's as though I received a most precious unique personal gift from Prince Charming himself. This is a ring that I will cherish for life.  Money can't buy such a blessing!  Thanks Joe.
"
"I ~LOVE~ this. It  is even nicer than the photo, with a beautiful contrast of copper on the inner center loop on the sides. All the details show up beautifully. This is a great value for the price!
"
"Beautiful work! I love the ring. I have fat fingers and ring was able to adjust to the size I needed. Shipping was very fast and well packaged!! üíï‚ú®
"
"My ring arrived exceptionally fast with a sweet note attached! Very satisfied with my purchase and will def be ordering more jewelry soon!
"
"Love this ring. It arrived 2 weeks before anticipated and was wrapped beautifully. I‚Äôve gotten so many compliments on it, and have been directing everyone here for the amazing quality!
"
"This is a gorgeous little ring‚ÄîI love it! It is a little bit adjustable so I could make it fit my finger exactly, but with the way it is designed it doesn‚Äôt look adjustable from a viewing perspective, which is really nice.
"
"Love love love! These rings are amazing! Couldn‚Äôt be happier with the quality of the product and the quality of the customer service! They went above and beyond to accommodate my request and are an amazing company! They‚Äôve gained a customer for life!
"
"I ambsolutely loving this ring!
"
"I am so so happy with how my ring turned out! In my description I requested my stones be long and placed vertically and they were able to make that happen! It is so beautiful and reminds me of my friendship with my best friend every time I look at it. Thank you so much. I highly recommend Amy Waltz to anyone thinking about getting a custom ring!
"
"My ring exceeded my expectations. When I opened the beautifully package item I was taken away. I can‚Äôt say enough of how much I‚Äôm in love with my ring!
"
"quality perfect as described. shipped in a great amount of time considering these rings are each hand crafted. absolutely in love with my rings and already ordered a couple more for the special ladies in my life. so unique
"
"This ring came out beautiful and was customized exactly as requested. Love the raw gemstone look - and the quality is awesome!
"
"Absolutely BEAUTIFUL rings. i ordered two. i actually didn‚Äôt know my ring size so i just guessed lol. but they fit perfectly! probably my new favorite accessories!
"
"so obsessed ! it‚Äôs so cute and dainty will definitely be ordering again !ü§ç
"
"The ring is beautiful and fits perfectly! I bought the malachite because green is my boyfriend's favorite color and it reminds me of him when we're apart. It is exactly what I was looking for. Thank you so much!
"
"i couldnt figure out how to change my address but alicia was very helpful and super kind and was able to change it for me! they also responded quickly! THE RINGS!! they are beautiful, it fits perfectly and doesnt irritate my fingers when i wear them! its the perfect fit! could never say anything bad about them, i love them (:
"
"Even more beautiful in person!  good communication and fast shipping.  Thank you!
"
"Toller Ring :) w√ºrde ihn immer wieder kaufen :)
"
"Goes with everything and I have already had compliments.
"
 
"This ring is so beautiful! I‚Äôm very happy I went with Alya. Exactly what I was looking for, for everyday use! I got the topaz with rose gold and I can‚Äôt stop looking at it! Thank you!
"
"Vraiment heureuse de ma nouvelle bague, les photos ne lui rendent pas honneur ! En vrai elle est magnifique. J'ai eu un petit soucis de grandeur et la vendeuse m'en √† gentillement renvoy√© une autre √† ma taille! Merci beaucoup je l'adore
"
"Love this ring. My fingers are tiny so it was a perfect size.
"
"I cannot emphasize how absolutely stunning this ring is in person.  I am so happy!  Perfect look, perfect size, AND perfect price.  Thank you so much!
"
"I love the ring!  A tad different than the picture but that's okay.  The shipping and processing time took about 2 weeks, but patience is key and this ring was well worth the wait!  The packaging is also pretty adorable too.
"
"I bought the silver version of this two years ago and get compliments on it constantly (it‚Äôs still in perfect condition even though I wear it daily). When I found myself wearing more gold jewelry, I knew I needed a gold version of this staple piece! Arrived quickly and exactly as pictured. Love it so much!
"
"Such a beautiful ring!  Mel went out of her way to discuss sizing with me.  I ended up messing up my ring size and she was incredibly gracious and sent me a plastic ring sizer and adjusted it for me at no extra cost.  Such a lovely person to interact with.  Would love to buy jewelry from her again!
"
"This is a gorgeous ring....simple and  very classy design. It naturally goes with any other rings one wears on their other fingers; I love it!!
"
"I suggested to Olia to do this pattern in a necklace and earrings in my school colors.  She was optimistic about it and then I realized that they are also the colors of the Ukrainian flag!  It turned out just lovely.  This pattern will be good in the colors in the listing as well as custom colors.  Great design and execution on Olia's part!!!
"
"I believe that this was a one-off creation by Olia but I would highly recommend a similar necklace.  I requested it to go with these hematite earrings
https://www.etsy.com/listing/268330237/valentine-sale-25-hematite-dark-grey?ga_search_query=hematite&ref=shop_items_search_2
I wore this set for my birthday today for the first time and I am very happy with how artsy and beautiful it is.  It made my outfit.  I highly recommend the earrings and/or a similar necklace.  This is pure artistry.
"
"This is a BEAUTIFUL Ring. I love it.  It's lightweight and looks exactly as described in the picture.  I love it and will likely order more jewelry from this shop!! Thank you!
"
"Olga made me an assortment of tassel earrings to compliment a Beachwear collection I am showing at a fashion show.  She was a joy to work with and took on board what I wanted in terms of colour and design.  I look forward to working with her again in the future. Perfect product made with love x
"
"The ring is gorgeous in person. Getting tons of complements. So happy with my newest statement piece.
"
"Beautiful, beautiful, beautiful! I couldn't be happier with my purchase or how quickly it arrived! I've been looking for rings with jade that weren't the typical band and this fits the bill entirely. The stone's etchings are nothing short of stunning! Will definitely be purchasing from the seller again.
"
"I like my ring very much! It has a vintage look with a flower pattern on the jade. 
I was surprised how quickly it was delivered. Thank you!
"
"I love this ring.  I've had many compliments when I wear it.  It is a size to big so I have to adjust it w/tape.  Again, I love it.  It arrived promptly and was packed nicely.
"
"Here he is! This is the Snow Dragon! This is my 4th dragon from Monvatoo and once again it is absolutely gorgeous. I cannot rate these rings highly enough. So beautiful and so different. I have a little dragon family and hope to add to it soon! Maybe the Sapphire dragon!!!! Thank you.
"
"I had being admiring the black dragon ring but was thinking ""I wondering if they can do one like that but in white"". It seems they heard my thought as this little guy is just what I wanted! 

The delivery was very quick and well packaged and the quality and fit of the ring is great.  (I was a little worried that the ring would be too bulky for my petite hands or catch on things but found that wasn't a problem. Wearing it round so the wing goes over the knuckle works really well for smaller hands, the wing shape sweeps quite comfortably over the knuckle and so doesn't catch on the other fingers.)
"
"My ring came in much more quickly than what I thought it would, and its simply gorgeous! I'm gonna wear it every day and it fits beautifully. Definitely worth the money and I highly recommend any of these pieces. It's gorgeous and I've gotten a lot of compliments on it already.
"
"Excelente anillo. Si la imagen es preciosa la realidsd la supera con creces: el drsgon parece estar vivo....
Completamente rercomendable y perfects relacion calodad precio.
"
"Long time admirer, first time buyer. Wonderful experience!  Seller is conscientious and professional with a warm personal touch. Quality superb, ring lovely, international shipping as fast as it could be. She made sure I understood how long the creation and shipping would take (I.e. it was made to order, not ready to ship, and shipping from Germany to the US takes longer than within US) and then kept me updated at every step along the way. All time estimates were realistic and the item got to me slightly sooner than expected. Packaging and info included cute and professional. Love this seller; can‚Äôt wait to buy again!
"
"My ring is fantastic!!!  It was exactly what I was expecting üòä 
The owner has been extremely helpful as I got the size wrong üòû I cannot thank her enough for all of her help üòÅ
I will definitely buy from this shop again üòÑ
"
"I love this ring!  So creepy, so beautiful.  Thank you!!
"
"OMG!!  Too creepy! Perfect for Halloween, or any time you're feeling ghoulish!!  
So cool!!  üëª
"
"The ring arrived on time and in beautiful condition! I‚Äôm in love! I bought this ring as a temporary replacement for my wedding band/engagement ring and I‚Äôm so pleased! So pleased! 

I ordered a size slightly larger than the finger I had it slotted for. Just in case it 1) ran small or 2) ran big, so it would fit another finger, and it exceeded my expectations! (I wear a typical 1/2 size on most of my fingers so it‚Äôs a personal struggle of mine.) 

This ring is more gorgeous in person than in the pictures and worth it!
"
"A beautiful ring. Fit is perfect. Love it! Normal shipping from Europe.
"
"The ring is absolutely beautiful.  It arrived in excellent condition,  I will treasure it always!  A new heirloom for my daughter.
"
"Cette bague est tout simplement magnifique je l'adore merci au vendeur
"
"It's so beautiful; I love having a tiny Stargate on my finger. Thank you so much for making it!
"
"La bague est parfaite, magnifique dans les moindres d√©tails. Le d√©lais de livraison a √©t√© respect√© √† une semaine pr√®s. Par contre si vous commandez D'europe, pr√©voir des frais de douanes faramineux !
"
"The ring was beautiful and detailed, the inside was slightly curved for a comfortable fit and it didn't take away from the ring itself. My husband loves it. True be told I love it too!
"
"This is the wedding ring for my FH, he loves it and wears it all the time, Stargate has been his favorite show for a great many years! It is thicker than we expected but it does fit him well and with any ring he's become used to it after the initial adjustment period.
"
"Another darling creation by Genia. This is my fourth ring from GeshaR, and my third commissioned piece. Genia is such a gem to work with. This sweet wolf was rather shy and elusive and took her time coming into form, but Genia was wonderfully patient and brought her beautifully to life. Terrific artist and A+++ seller. Thanks a million, Genia. She is precious! üíï
"
"I bought this ring as a gift so I wasn't 100% sure it would fit.  Genia agreed to remake if necessary but there was no need - it fitted perfectly and the birthday girl loved it. Thank you
"
"An absolutely gorgeous ring that is expertly crafted. This ring is well worth the money paid, I would definitely buy again. Dont let the shipping distance scare you either, it came reasonably fast.
"
"Gorgeous wolf ring! Love the lighter silver finish of this and the details (tiny paws, etc.). Thanks for the wonderful craftsmanship. I'm eyeing your owls and ravens now!
"
"such a lovely ring, very detailed, really good quality im so in love with it! Definitely gonna be buying from this shop again its worth it!!
"
"The ring is so extremely beautiful. We were just amazed at the quality of custom detail that went into this ring. The stone is also stunning. This ring is exceptionally fantastic as to the quality and detail of craftsmanship as we received it. Your company is one of kind and I am so thankful that we found BlackTree. The ring is perfect.  I really want to thank you so much and I am so grateful to find such a fine jeweler who does such high quality and unique custom type of jewelry. Would purchase from this jeweler again.
"
"This ring was gorgeous and the shipping was very fast. It was lighter than I expected but I love it
"
"Gorgeous ring! Color of the stone was lighter than pictured (I was hoping for a darker Amber), but the seller disclosed that possibility beforehand. The ring is still lovely and otherwise as-pictured.
"
 
 
 
 
"Beautiful ring! It came about 2 weeks after I ordered it all the way from Ukraine with really cute packaging and a postcard! The ring fits perfectly, is smooth and really comfortable and nice to touch. I'm so glad you do quarter sizes!! I purchased to have a ring to wear in place of my wedding ring, because my wedding ring is size 4 1/2 and it's a bit too small now after having a baby. But size 5 is too big. The 4 3/4 is perfect! Also I am not supposed to wear metal sometimes at work due to issues with electrical equipment but I can wear this!
"
"Wow this ring looks amazing with my other amber jewelry that I have purchased from you. I l used a necklace to make the bracelet,  I love wearing them.
"
"Thank you for the beautiful earrings...they are very special..the card was beautiful as well.
"
"This ring is absolutely stunning, fits perfectly and feels high quality. The owner of the shop, Oksana, is lovely too and provided fantastic service throughout. Oksana went out of her way to ensure the package would make its way to me, despite a change in addresses on my end. She even wrote a nice note and popped it inside the package with the ring. Highly recommend. Thank You!
"
"muy bonito el anillo y la entrega fue en 4 dias
"
"Beautiful ring! Nice quality - weighty but not too heavy. It‚Äôs comfortable to wear. Hasn‚Äôt tarnished after many hand washings. Shipped and arrived super quickly with nice packaging. Really happy with this purchase!
"
"I am amazed! Not only is the piece beautiful and shiny. But the shipping and handling was extremely fast! Mind blown. Definitely look forward to making another order soon from this shop/seller. Thank you!
"
"love these rings! and they came very fast.
"
"The shipping company took forever but the seller did all they could to help. It took 4 months to arrive but it is a beautiful ring.
"
"The emerald stones are a stunning colour, this is a beautiful hand-made ring to wear and behold.
"
"Service of Anushka was excellent.
"
 
"Such a sweet seller she helped me with many things! She has great products and is very sweet. The packaging is so cute too! If you‚Äôve thought about buying from her you should! She has amazing prices and I love the ring!
"
"I really really like it definitely worth the wait
"
 
"Super cute! Wish I would‚Äôve sized up, I‚Äôm usually a 6, but I think it‚Äôs a little snug since it‚Äôs a wider ring! I love it in my pinky though.
"
"I loved my rings! Thank you
"
"What a beautiful ring! Great size, the stone is amazing. And I got a little gift -- thanks so much!
"
"Stunning is the only word to describe this ring. It is high quality and catches the light in a really gorgeous way. I absolutely love it!
"
"I absolutely love the product, the packaging and the sheer kindness. I would definitely purchase again!
"
"This ring is even more beautiful in person! I have been on a hunt for a yellow gold and sapphire ring for no joke 4 years! I even purchased one from a popular jewelry retailer and ended up returning it because the sapphire was so dark it looked black. When I found this one by Olga I was so excited at the beauty AND the price! When I received it in the mail my jaw dropped! The sapphire is a beautiful shade of true blue and the gold is wonderful quality! It did take about a month to arrive, but only because of the international shipping. The shop shipped out my purchase the day after I ordered it! Very quick on their end. I can‚Äôt wait to buy more items from this seller. So beautiful and happy with my purchase! :)
"
"This ring is, of course, not the real deal. But, no one will guess! I wear it with a band of real white gold, real diamonds and real sapphires. If you really study the silver/gold you can‚Äôt see a difference because the bands are thin. The stones are very realistic. I love the silver work on the underside of the ring. No one sees it but me but I know it‚Äôs there!
I got the ring super fast all the way from Israel.
I am sure all their jewelry is perfect like this ring. I will be buying from here again.
"
"We requested moonstones instead of quartz for the side stones and it turned out perfectly.  Such a unique engagement ring, I've received so many compliments, and it holds up to wear well.  So beautiful, I can't stop staring at my hand.
"
"100% worth every cent/shekel. I‚Äôd seen the reviews so, naturally, I knew it would be beautimous. But what I received far surpassed all expectations. This is so gorgeous and I‚Äôm so happy!
"
 
"This ring is a show stopper, gets noticed where ever I go. The picture doesn't do justice, the stones are beautiful and the unique setting gets a second look every time.   The best part is how it feels on my hand, energetically empowering and calming at the same time.  Couldn't be happier, Grateful, Grateful.
"
"Arrived on time and more stunning in person.  It is heavier and quality beyond my expectations.  The stone is brilliant and this beauty gets noticed wherever I go.  Very happy with this purchase and would recommend highly, thanks so much!!
"
"The ring matches the earrings, but it is bigger in diameter than I expected ed and a little too big to be flattering to my hand.  I will certainly wear it from time to time.

"I love my London Cityscape ring! I went to graduate school in London and I had been looking for something like this since I returned to the states. It arrived within 2 weeks of me ordering it and Ola was very helpful in communicating with me. I read the reviews before I purchased so I knew to order a size larger than what I normally wear which ended up being a really good thing- I can wear the ring on either my middle finger or my thumb! The only thing I would tell people to keep an eye on is the London Eye through Tower Bridge section. They tend to get caught on clothes and other things pretty easily so just be mindful when you're wearing it not to snag your sweaters!
"
"Absolutely beautiful details in my ring and received much sooner than anticipated.  The only problem is that now I want them all! <3 Thank you!!!
"
"Absolutely love my London ring. Love the details! Would highly recommend!!!
"
"I have been looking for something that would remind me of the years I lived in London and what a beautiful city it is. This ring is perfect! It is beautifully crafted and extremely detailed. It is a piece of London I can take with me everywhere I go. Seller is very helpful too. Highly recommended!
"
"I am in love with this ring! Perfect gift and fits great. It did take longer to get here than I thought it would. Over all a great ring and will use the shop again.
"
"Absolutely love this ring. It's thick enough to be more study than one I had bought elsewhere. Holding up perfectly for daily wear! I never take it off.
"
"This ring is beautiful! I'd bought another one from a different vendor a few years ago that was much thinner and it broke... I was very happy when I received this one- it's a little thicker and more sturdy, but still dainty. Absolutely thrilled with it!
"
"So beautiful!!! <3 Love it!

"Die Ohrstecker habe ich erst nach negativer Bewertung und E-Mail-Kontakt mit der Verk√§uferin erhalten. Die erste Lieferung musste ich dann leider wieder zur√ºck schicken: Die Motive waren sehr bl√§ulich und dunkel und ein Stecker war verkratzt. Mit der zweiten Sendung bin ich jetzt zufrieden. Die Ohrstecker sind sehr niedlich, aber immer noch etwas dunkler als abgebildet.
"
"Ich habe am 11.Dezember bestellt und mich nach einer Woche gewundert, dass noch nichts ankam. Am 18.Dezember habe ich nachgehakt und einen Tag sp√§ter die Auskunft bekommen, dass die Ohrringe am Montag nochmal versendet werden. Nun ist es Mittwoch Abend (23.Dezember) und ich habe immer noch nichts erhalten! Sehr entt√§uschend!
"
"Die Ohrringe (insgesamt 4 Paar bestellt - 3 Paar geliefert) sind leider erst nach mehrfachem Nachfragen und Faller√∂ffnung angekommen. Lt. Shop wurde 2x versandt, 3 Paar kamen dann mit der 3. Lieferung. F√ºr das 4. Paar erhielt ich nach kurzer Abstimmung die Gutschrift. Ich erhielt das Angebot, mir 2 Extras quasi als Ausgleich und Entschuldigung auszusuchen.

"This ring is SO beautiful! The black CZ catches the light so wonderfully, making the ring stand out and sparkle. It's definitely a show piece, without being over-the-top. This definitely will not be my last purchase from Bar Argent!
"
"I've always been a fan of art deco styled jewelry. This ring was exactly what i was looking for.
"
"This ring is so unique.   It really shipped fast.
"
"This ring is beautiful!  Even better than I thought it would be. I‚Äôm not normally a jewelry person, not even my wedding ring, but decided the time has come. Saw this ring, decided to give it a try.  I‚Äôm still not a jewelry person but will wear this ring as my wedding ring, it‚Äôs very pretty. Would order from here again.
"
"The peacock ring is absolutely GORGEOUS!! I cannot even begin to describe how it completely lived up to and surpassed my expectations, based on the photos. It‚Äôs truly a work of art; it will take me awhile to bring myself to wear it, it‚Äôs just so pretty! Will definitely be purchasing from this shop again.
"
"I love love love this ring!!!!  I've been stalking it for a while and finally bought it and am so glad I did!  I've received so many compliments on it.  Thank you!!!!
"
"This is probably one of the most beautiful rings I own! Simply gorgeous. Lovely package as well.
"
"It is a gorgeous enamel ring. Love it! Love it!
"
"I love my gold band, it‚Äôs is absolutely beautiful, just like the picture! Gorgeous! I will be back! 
Thank you Lucia

"I just received my stack rings & they are so unique & beautiful. Don‚Äôt think I‚Äôll ever take them off. Will definitely be ordering from this company again!!!  The rings were delivered on time. The seller was very responsive with answers to my questions

"Very pretty ring!  I asked for it to be left more on the matte side, and I think it looks very cool!  Ring kind of glows.
"
"This ring is a little wider than Venexia‚Äôs traditional wedding band, but I love gold, so of course I had to buy the thicker one!! If you have read my other posts, you already know how much I LOVE each and every ring that Dany (shop owner) has made me. She communicates well, the jewels are wrapped gorgeously, and the products are out of this world!!! Trust me, you will love anything you buy from this shop!!

"I ordered a size bigger than what I usually wear since the tube shape usually fits more snugly. I really love it! There is quite a bit of movement in the outside rings but it feels right as a ‚Äúfidget‚Äù or meditation ring. Absolutely beautiful!
"
"This ring is even more beautiful than I expected, and the spinner is perfect. I love this ring!
"
"i absolutely love love love this item.....it is made beautifully and it fits like a glove......fascinating piece with the spinners........will be ordering more from this seller........workmanship is gorgeous...thank you
"
"This ring is AMAZING for my anxiety. I am trying to stop picking at my thumb and it‚Äôs a beautiful way to exchange a bad habit for a good one. Also I had measured wrong the first time and Celia exchanged it for one that fit with no issues. She was very responsive and helpful. I absolutely LOVE this ring! Thank you ByCeliaJewelry!
"
"Shipping took a couple weeks but I had expected that & the owners were good with responding to my questions. The ring was definitely worth the wait it‚Äôs of good quality & fits true to size. I would buy from this account again!
"
"This is the best ring for a pinky ring. Perfect size, great detail. I love it.
"
"Love this ring, just like I wanted!
"
"Okay this ring is beautifully made
"
"So Azmazing, all those beautiful sparkles make u feel like ur up in the sky, I love this piece, I recommend this to anyone!
"
"I love this ring! For the price, I expected it to be a low quality party favor. I was so pleasantly surprised with the quality and the fit, and the packaging was lovely.
"
"Very beautiful üíô
"
"sweet, whimsical and wonderful.  Nothing more to say.
Love them!

"Bought this b/c my original name ring is in storage lol. This ring is nice and much smaller then my original but I do like it very much. Thank you!
"
"Fantastic! The quality is excellent! Not bulky or heavy! Looks like the one my grandmother got me that‚Äôd package away in storage. Thank you for a great ring! I HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!!!
"
"Love it! Got here just in time for the holiday.
"

"
"perfectly crafted
"
 
 
 
 
"Love Love Love!! My ring fits perfectly and came way faster than expected. Will definitely be purchasing more. So unique!
"
"The ring came quickly, fits beautifully, looks incredible, and I am very excited to make it one of my everyday pieces of jewelry
"
"Omg! I purchased the moonstone ring and I absolutely love it! It‚Äôs so beautifully designed and looks fabulous in person. You will not be disappointed!! I will be ordering again.
"
"Super DOOPER pretty. This ring is so dang pretty and different too which is fun, all the onesI found in stores weren't nearly so unique.
"
"Very impressed with the ring, the quality of the ring, the workmanship, the time it took to get here. I didn't give much time till my bfs birthday but he was sure to get it done and out in time. The ring is gorgeous and the bf absolutely loves it. Thank you so so so so so much.
"
"Absolutely the best ring I could have imagined!! We lost our best friend and companion Cosmo unexpectedly and this Cosmos was perfect!
It came in a Beautifully made wooden box. Shipping was extremely fast. And the service on ring sizing and communication was excellent!
I am truly grateful to have found them! üñ§üíú
"
"They were fast, accurate, and excellent with communication. I‚Äôm delighted with my ring and highly recommend using them!
"
"Let me just say! I have been waiting for this to come in the mail ever since I made the order. I was so excited to receive my custom made ring from csac. I am absolutely over the moon with my ring. It‚Äôs so freakin beautiful! The owner of the shop is so kind, and patient. She answered all of my questions as soon as they came. I had sent in some of my own opals to incorporate into this amazing ring and it turned out to be everything I expected and more! The best part about this order was the beautiful handmade box it came in, that they even engraved for me, all for free! If you‚Äôre looking to get a custom ring made I highly recommend Cottonstreet Art Co. They pour their love into making their rings. I‚Äôm truly grateful for this company for giving me such a beautiful creation I can give to my husband to cherish forever.
"
"This ring is beautiful! From the pictures I thought it was going to be a thick, heavy ring, but it's much more light, intricate, and delicate than I expected. I got it for my boyfriend and he loved it. The seller was great and even included some happy birthday confetti in the box when they saw that my note included a birthday message. They also hand wrote my birthday message for me, which was a lovely touch. Wonderful experience, thank you! I want another ring for myself now :)
"
"I got my turquoise Japanese coin ring last week, and it is absolutely gorgeous and fits so nicely and so comfortably. Super satisfied with my jewelry, and would definitely purchase from this seller again; I had a few questions because my address was wrong and because I was wondering if the ring would trigger any of my allergies (it didn't, so even better), and he responded cordially and in a timely fashion. Five stars. :)
"
"I really love the color and design. I thought the ring was going to be a little bigger but it's fine! I noticed that after washing my hands a few times with the ring on, the color is faded in certain areas. Not sure if this is normal. Other than that the ring is beautiful!
"
"This ring is stunning.  It is extraordinary in craftmanship.  I absolutely love it.   It does take a couple of weeks but it's worth the wait.
"
"Love love love love love. The top photo shows the contrast in direct sunlight, and the bottom is inside. Depending on the lighting the grey will be more pronounced. (The colors seen in the bottom photo are from a stained glass window reflecting nearby!) I absolutely love this ring and am so glad we chose to order from Lena. She answered any and every question I had and the ring took only 3 days to arrive once shipped. After spending weeks looking for a salt and pepper diamond, I was thrilled to come across this listing. If you are even considering a salt and pepper diamond, do not hesitate to inquire about this beauty!
"
"I can‚Äôt stop staring at my new engagement ring! Honestly it‚Äôs one of the prettiest rings I‚Äôve ever seen. My fianc√© is very proud of it and I‚Äôm a very happy fianc√©e. He says his favorite part is how much I love it. Lena was amazing and patient answering all our questions about fitting it with wedding bands we had from my grandma. She even gave us a little sneak video to help with our excitement (though to be honest it was all my excitement)!  Shipping was incredibly fast! I hear nothing but compliments when people notice my ring!
"
"So this is my second engagement ring, we got it to match my fianc√©‚Äôs wedding band since his is grey/black with black diamonds + rose gold trim. It‚Äôs so beautiful in person and people love it! 
I put a photo of the 2 ct. salt and pepper ring with rose gold alongside my original ring (not from etsy) which is a .65 center white diamond for comparison. My ring size is a 3.5. The seller was very nice and sent me a video and photo of the diamond she would use.
"
"YES...buy the ring! I too was hesitant to purchase such a high end item online, so I did research, even contacting other reviewers here on Etsy about their purchases. Lena is AMAZING to work with. After choosing the band I wanted, Lena found (and sent me a video) of three different center stone options to fit my budget. The ring was estimated to be finished in 1-2 weeks, but it took three weeks because of Covid (understandable delay.) Before shipping, Lena again sent a video showing the finished product. The ring was shipped from Israel on a Thursday, and I had it in my possession in America on Monday! The ring is absolutely gorgeous. The color and sparkle of the diamonds are amazing. My wife and I are both very happy with this purchase. We will not hesitate to purchase more jewelry from Lena in the future.
"
 
 
"I have been eyeing this ring for I don‚Äôt even remember how long, LOL! I don‚Äôt know why I waited so long because not only is it lightweight and gorgeous, but I can actually write with it on. I am so in love!
"
"This ring is even more gorgeous than what I saw in the pictures! It is super light, and although big, is not cumbersome on my finger. I will definitely come back to this shop!!!
"
"I absolutely love this ring! It looks exactly as pictured and is really beautiful and unique. Extremely pleased with this purchase!!
"
"Absolutely love my necklace. Wore it with my Easter outfit and received many compliments!
"
"I bought these earrings and the matching ring as my first purchase from TomasCross shop.  I loved them so much, I went on to buy quite a few more earring and ring sets.  I love how these sets manage to be chic and edgy and not at all kitschy.  They are very well-made and the artwork is precise and distinct.  The jewelry aspect is sturdy.  I am always excited to wear these pieces!
"
"IT IS ADORABLE.  I GAVE IT TO MY DOCTOR WHO HAS 6 DOGS AND IS AN EXCELLENT CROSS STITCH EXPERT.  IT WAS A GREAT HIT.  CAME ALL PACKAGED NICE-NO DAMAGE.
"
"I love this ring. The silver is shiny, it's not as oxidized as in the product photo, but that's okay. It's very pretty. The stone is really beautiful. It catches light very nicely and has a nice ""glow"" to it that looks different when daylight or artificial light hits it.

It shipped very quickly, quicker than the estimate given by Etsy. It was really well packaged in a little plastic box with lots of padding around it.

I ordered the wrong size by accident, reached out to the seller and let them know and they were very quick to respond and okay with me changing the size in my order and sending me the correct size I wanted.

Tried to capture the beautiful glow in the ring in my photo. (My other rings are from IndigoDreamerJewelry)

I would definitely buy this product again (as a gift) and buy from this seller again. :)
"
"I received my beautiful Moonstone ring today and it is even more gorgeous in person and on my finger!  My Moonstone ring is home!   I've not had a ring like this, I will cherish it.  Thank you!!!
Gloria.
"
"the ring took long to get here which is understandable because it‚Äôs from india but once it came i fell in love. it is so beautiful!
"
"Super super happy with this product. I‚Äôve already received so many compliments and it‚Äôs the first day I‚Äôve worn it!! Big shout out to the vender for resending me another ring as the one I ordered months ago never arrived. I received this one within just over a week of it being resent!! Such great service :)
"
"Beautiful! May need to get one size up...tight fit..
"
"I have several of Galyna's rings. They are all so beautiful and beautifully made.  I also now have a really pretty pair of her earrings.  I can't say enough how happy I am with my purchases.
"
"Super adorable!! I bought them for my wedding and they were absolutely perfect for our butterfly bluff ceremony. I've gotten so many compliments on them, I can't wait to wear them more.
"
"These are spectacular I love love love them high quality and colors are vibrant and I‚Äôm always surprised with her quality and colors are so beautiful‚Äîalso they are not too heavy for my ears and I‚Äôm older and my ears pull down and these work!  Durability appears to be there as well‚ÄîI just received all of her earrings so hoping they will last and I‚Äôm very careful with these kinds of earrings‚Äîso very happy with purchase always and ordered three more because these are my outfits working on zoom all the time!
"
"I absolutely adore this ring. It‚Äôs not very often you can find Vincent Van Gogh‚Äôs Starry Starry Night in a ring. It arrived very quickly too! Thank you!!
"
"This is the most unique ring in my collection, I get so many compliments and I'm absolutely obsessed! I love how it is adjustable and can go on any finger. The artwork is so beautiful. Thank you thank you!
"
"Beautiful ring. Only thing I would say I ""dislike"" (I'm being a tad nit picky) is the thickness of the glass. I wish it wasn't as raised (if that makes sense?). Other than that, I stink it's absolutely beautiful. I especially love the band design. If I could I would buy a ring that was plain with just the band.
"
"The ring is super cute and I get lots of compliments on it. The seller was great to work with and always responded back quickly.
"
"This ring goes with anything & everything. Usually I mix match it with my other gold jewelry created 2-tones visual effects!!
"
"So cute! This ring has completely met my expectations! I'm so happy with it!
"
"I absolutely love my ring. I can definitely see the quality of the ring; it is perfect for travel lovers. Kelly is an amazing communicator and answered my questions immediately. I will definitely buy from this shop again.
"
"SIMPLY AMAZING!!!! beautiful, lightweight, precious ring perfect all year long. I had difficulties with the shipping but was wildly worth it. Thanks Kelly!
"
"I purchased this ring for my girlfriend. She loves it. The quality seems good and the stone looks nice. 

Shipping took a bit, but from Ukraine to USA takes a bit... it was about two and a half weeks. Tracking information was included and could be tracked all the way to my address. 

It was a good purchase experience and I would recommend the ring and the seller.
"
"The ring arrived on time and in beautiful condition! I‚Äôm in love! I bought this ring as a temporary replacement for my wedding band/engagement ring and I‚Äôm so pleased! So pleased! 

I ordered a size slightly larger than the finger I had it slotted for. Just in case it 1) ran small or 2) ran big, so it would fit another finger, and it exceeded my expectations! (I wear a typical 1/2 size on most of my fingers so it‚Äôs a personal struggle of mine.) 

This ring is more gorgeous in person than in the pictures and worth it!
"
"This ring is beautiful and well made!
"
"This was absolutely what I was looking for. I was looking for a swoosh ring and this one was beautiful.
"
"I cant even expressed how wonderful this ring is, the price, the craftsmanship, how absolutely ridiculous comfortable it is, and all the other designs are so cool and unique as long as this store is open I will be buying from them.
"
"My experience has been completely positive. The promptness of service and customer service communication was excellent. However, the star of this transaction is the beautiful, artistic, well-fitting ring. It is a true work of art!
"
"Ring is great, my girlfriend loves it!
"
"I love this ring. It's hard to find a raven ring that sits close to the hand. The sculpting is lovely and expressive.  My only concern is that the band with the tourmaline is so tiny, I'm afraid I might lose it. The seller was great at communicating, which I think is so important when buying expensive jewelry on line.
"
 
 
"This ring is a show stopper, gets noticed where ever I go. The picture doesn't do justice, the stones are beautiful and the unique setting gets a second look every time.   The best part is how it feels on my hand, energetically empowering and calming at the same time.  Couldn't be happier, Grateful, Grateful.
"
"Arrived on time and more stunning in person.  It is heavier and quality beyond my expectations.  The stone is brilliant and this beauty gets noticed wherever I go.  Very happy with this purchase and would recommend highly, thanks so much!!

"
"I absolutely love my ring and have gotten so many compliments! The company also responded very quickly to my questions and delivery time was very short!
"
"Gorgeous, gets tones of compliments and many people asking where did I buy it. Detail work is great
"
"Amazing!!! I love it SO much, I‚Äôve been wanting a thumb ring forever and this is honestly the perfect one. I thought it wasn‚Äôt going to fit me but it‚Äôs perfect, and adjustable!
"
"LOVE! LOVE! LOVE! MY RING!!!!
"
"My ring came quickly, the quality is great just like the picture shows. I would recommend buying it if you like the picture. Well worth the money!!
"
"I am so happy with this ring.  It is so cute and exactly what I was looking for.  I will order again and definitely recommend to family and friends.
"
"Super cute and exactly what I was wanting. It's definitely an everyday ring for me now!
"
"i love my ring! it‚Äôs beautiful and exactly what i thought it would be. the seller is extremely sweet :) thank you so much!
"
"It came fast and looked so beautiful! It was packed in layers of bubble wrap to keep it safe which I thought was sweet:) sizing was perfect, I absolutely love it!
"
"This ring is perfect! I have small hands so the size is just right. The workmanship is excellent. so glad I bought this!
"
"the perfect ring for life post-vaccine. thank you!
"
"This ring is sooo cute and sparkly! Everytime I look at it I can't help smiling! It fit perfectly on my pointer finger, no adjustment needed. I love it to death and would 100% recommend buying!
"
"Great communication; you can tell that they really care about their customers‚Äô satisfaction. 
I totally love my ring. It‚Äôs comfortable to wear. I‚Äôm already thinking about what other number rings I want to order next.
"
"This ring is beyond amazing!!! I love it so much! Amanda was so sweet and I will definitely order from this shop again!
"
"My ring arrived today! So dainty and pretty. It's actually prettier in person.  Fast delivery too less than a week.
"
"I am obsessed! So happy I bought this ring. It‚Äôs gorgeous!
"
"Honestly so beautiful and stunning, I totally forgot it was coming so it was a nice surprise for the mailbox, but I 1000011000/10 recommend this ring, it‚Äôs so delicate and dainty, I have small hands and sometimes think my hands are stubby but this ring just compliments it. Well worth the buy üíõ
"
"I just received my ring in the mail after ordering it 2 weeks ago! The ring is absolutely gorgeous in person! I can‚Äôt wait to purchase more in the future.
"
"A beautiful ring, it‚Äôs much more prettier then in the picture. Very positive comments received. I‚Äôm so pleased I bought it. I have ordered another one!
"
"Very beautiful. It shipped pretty fast and came in a cute box. I also love how it‚Äôs adjustable and can fit in any finger. I would definitely buy again from this seller! 10/10
"
"I shall add a picture later on, but for now I just wanted to express just how much I simply love my ring! :) It was money well spent! Thank you very much!
"
"I think that this is really neat and it's a lot cheaper than if you would look for the same kind of ring at other shops and it looks so flashy and sophisticated like my other one and I will probably wear it almost every day. Very beautiful and unique.
"
"Thank you so much! I love my new ring! It's exactly as described. The ring arrived on time with a very sweet note! Thank you!
"
"Very pretty, I'm totally satisfied.  Thank you for the nice transaction.  I will buy again.
"
"Beautiful ring! It came about 2 weeks after I ordered it all the way from Ukraine with really cute packaging and a postcard! The ring fits perfectly, is smooth and really comfortable and nice to touch. I'm so glad you do quarter sizes!! I purchased to have a ring to wear in place of my wedding ring, because my wedding ring is size 4 1/2 and it's a bit too small now after having a baby. But size 5 is too big. The 4 3/4 is perfect! Also I am not supposed to wear metal sometimes at work due to issues with electrical equipment but I can wear this!
"
"This ring is absolutely stunning, fits perfectly and feels high quality. The owner of the shop, Oksana, is lovely too and provided fantastic service throughout. Oksana went out of her way to ensure the package would make its way to me, despite a change in addresses on my end. She even wrote a nice note and popped it inside the package with the ring. Highly recommend. Thank You!
"
"This ring is absolutely beautiful. I feel that every picture I take does not do it justice! For anyone wondering, It only took a week to ship to Michigan. Thank you Alya.
"
"I am OBSESSED with this ring. Alya was super responsive and the shipping was fairly quick considering it came to the US via Turkey. Great shop!
"
"Stunning.
"
"This ring is simple and beautiful and Alya was very responsive and easy to work with.
"
"I have a good friend in Brazil who thought Joanna's Rune Rings were the coolest he'd ever seen.   His birthday was coming up so I decided to buy rings as a present.  The trouble is I was leaving for Brazil in 2 weeks which is too short for her to custom make the rings. Joanna made a heroic effort and got me the rings 1 day before I had to leave for Brazil.   The rings are beautiful and my friend loves them.  Thanks Joanna for going above and beyond to get me the order in record time!   Tom
"
"These rings are gorgeous! They all fit well, and they work pretty well on my tiny hands. Unfortunately, Algiz tends to catch on things as the band is mounted low on the Rune. And because of the shape of my thumb, Othala rotates a lot, so I will most likely have it sized for another finger. 
All in all, I am very pleased with these rings (even though they can catch on things sometimes). They are well made, beautiful, mystic, and garner quite a few questions. They also arrived far quicker than I expected! 
I will certainly purchase from Joanna again! Thank you very much!
"
"Simply Gorgeous set of rings! I wear them almost daily. The detail is amazing, even nicer in person. The fit was perfect, all sized just as I requested. The shipping was very fast too, and the seller is super sweet. I'd buy again in a heartbeat  ^_^
"
"I am just thrilled with these gorgeous rings.

The rings arrived in shipping material that protected the jewelry inside but that was not wasteful. Inside the shipping package was a black box with very cool black cording artfully wrapped around it that matched the feel of the jewelry. This was wrapped in red tissue paper and inside of a sheer black bag with a thank you card.

The rings themselves are just fantastic. Exquisite attention to detail. Gorgeous design. Beautiful finish. Wonderfully crafted. Perfectly sized. I have wanted these for some time now & am so very happy with them. She's an amazing artist. I would buy out her studio if I could. 

Further, she was wonderful to deal with, very responsive to communications. Very patient. Sized & shipped to me promptly upon her receipt of the sizes. I really couldn't be happier.
"
"I received my ring today! It‚Äôs gorgeous! It‚Äôs beautiful! I can‚Äôt believe it‚Äôs so beautiful! The craftsmanship is excellent! I‚Äôm completely in love with this ring! Thank you so very much!!! üíú
"
"This ring is absolutely beautiful! I love it and haven‚Äôt taken it off since it arrived. I get tons of compliments every time I wear it. A dealer at an antique show thought it was theirs (I was trying other things on). Detailed craftsmanship. You can tell it‚Äôs hand made. Will buy from again!
"
"This blue sapphire art deck style ring is really lovely.   I love  the  cut,  and the detail is quite  intricate.   A very beautiful purchase,  excellent  communication and lightning speed delivery.   Thank you!
"
"Worth the wait!!!  Spectacular vintage-art deco ring. Jenny's communication was great during the whole process.  The ring was well packaged and tracking was provided. I hope to order from her again.  Very pleased!!!
"
"I am very happy with my ring. It took a few days to form it correctly to my finger but that had more to do with my lack of knowledge of my ring size then the ring. Looks great like the photo ( even better in person). I've been getting many compliments from Michiganders and non-michiganders a like. A great reminder of home.
"
"My family has bought this ring 5 times for ourselves and friends.  I lost mine and HAD to reorder; I missed it so!  I think it runs a little big, so I would suggest getting it a half size smaller than you normally would.  The seller is great and shipping was fast.
"
"This ring is beautiful and delicate. I love it! As a Michigan girl (from the Kalamazoo area) who moved away a long time ago but whose heart is always there with family, this gives me a classy way to outwardly display my love for my home state (no slogans on T-shirts here!) Thanks so much!
"
"I love this ring. It fits and looks great. the only downside is that the copper part is starting to look a little discolored, but I am sure I can find a way to shine it back up. This ring was totally worth the splurge and I'm thinking about adding the silver one to my collection too!
"
"This sunflower ring is gorgeous! Fits perfectly. It looks just like the picture, if not better. I looked at other sunflower rings on etsy and just was not impressed. This one is worth the small wait and price!!
"
"Absolutely love this ring!
It did not fit the first time so I sent it back, she resized it and got it back to me so fast! Would highly recommend!
"
"Absolutely gorgeous!!üåª‚ô•Ô∏è
"
"I absolutely love this ring. I was really hoping that James Avery had a sunflower ring at the time I found this ring but they did not. However they did come out with one now and I still do not regret this purchase it is nicer and more unique. Something you don't see everyone wearing. I get so many compliments.
"
"Super cute!!! Im so in love with this ring, the quality is amazing. Worth the wait :)
"
"SO GORGEOUS! 
Really a show stopper, this one. P: Had a long hustle shipping, but the seller was really communicative with me when it matter. Beautiful packaging and craftsmanship, love this ring!!
"
"My daughter's high school graduation ring!  Many many compliments; its darling and very original.  The packaging was exquisite.
"
"So beautiful and wellmade artpiece im speakless! :) and it also didnt end up in the tull with extra payment or anything thats perfect it went crazy fast to! im so happy with my purchase! :)
"
"Stunning ring! I love it. The sizing was a little off for the finger I had intended it for so make sure you measure correctly when ordering. None the less, it looks great on! Extremely fast shipping, go for the Express option. Worth it! I will definitely be ordering again and probably very soon. Thank you :)
"
":)  I love the color, and the size and simple, modern setting.  I am really happy with my ring.  I can still wear gloves over it, despite the statement size of it, too! <3 would definitely buy again from this seller.
"
"Beautiful ring ‚Äì fits perfectly! My stone is more of a lovely amber hue. May want to specify to  seller if you want a more yellow stone, or a more amber stone (if the color varies).
"
"I purchased the Citrine ring and it is gorgeous! The color of the stone is beautiful. It makes a great statement ring.
"
"Had communication all the way through and could not be happier. I love this ring, it's so cute!
"
"Delicate and slim this feels great on my finger.  I live the snake details and oxidized finish.
"
"I just love this ring. I was looking for a ring like this for a long time that didn't look creepy. This Ouroboros ring is just perfect and sweet. I've had a great experience. Great customer service. Great product. Great person. Thanks Bare Branch Jewelry!
"
"This ring is more beautiful than I could have even imagined. I can't wait to start wearing this ring forever.
"
"This ring is beautiful, love how its stamped and love the little plane image inside...it came just in time for my trip to paris and so quickly did not expect it to come so fast...brilliant have my eye on a few more rings in your shop just counting down till payday..x
"
"I'm so excited about this ring! I love to travel and this is perfect for me. It's adjustable which is so nice and it looks great.
"
"Really pretty ring and I love how I can make it tighter or looser. It‚Äôs a great statement ring too.
"
"Adorable! Just be sure to adjust it to the right size first. I played around with the sizing of mine, always switching fingers, and it lead the metal to weaken and break. But a very well loved piece, and I‚Äôll be back for WAY too many more :) Great ring, with a great inscription
"
"Absolutely beautiful! I am so so happy with this, it is gorgeous and flawless and everything I hoped for, and it came so quickly! Thank you so much!
"
"My ring just got here today, way faster than I expected.  It's so lovely! Sometimes it's hard to tell if things are good quality and worth your money on etsy, and this ring certainly is. I love it, thank you so much!! :)
"
"Love this wring, I ware it every day.  I get so many compliments on it.  Next is the piggy ring.  Quality, quality and more quality.
"
"Beautiful ring!!  I love it so much! It is crafted so beautiful.  Shipping was so quick.  I could not be happier with this purchase. :)
"
"Just as perfect as my first purchase from this store. üíñ The stones have a  beautiful mid-blue color (not at all greenish as the pictures suggest; more like the blues in the review photos) and the band is as comfortable as a sock: it is concave and very nicely polished. Because of the width of the band, size 7 fits well on my ring finger, where I usually wear 6 3/4. If you are going to buy just one ring here, this should be it! I have looked all over Etsy and have not found anything like it for this price-or any price. Also, it shipped like lightning. The ring was in my mailbox in four days. Highly recommended as you can guess. ü§© Cinder sez this is the best so far.
"
"The ring is beautiful. üíïWonderful craftsmanship! This is the second ring I have purchased and they both have exceeded my expectations. I will buy again from this shop for sure! üòä Thank you!
"
"I am in love with my ring. It is more beautiful than the picture. Shipping was very fast. I am very happy with my purchase. Thank you!
"
"The first ring I ordered did not fit, but they were fantastic about letting me return and exchange for the correct size.  I love the ring, wear it all the time, and get loads of complements on it.  Thank you!
"
"I LOVE this ring! I bought it with the Dakota ring (as styled in the photo) and I get compliments on it every time. My new favorite accessory to wear :)
"
"I have NEVER gotten more compliments on my jewelry than with this ring! I love it so much I got the matching black ring that goes with it and its just so special to me! I will buy up everything in this shop!
"
"Such a cute ring! I have chubby/bigger fingers and I‚Äôm so glad that this ring can compliment them. The ring sits a bit crooked on my finger, but it‚Äôs nothing too major. Love the price and love the quality!
"
"Love this ring, it‚Äôs SO unique I‚Äôm obsessed! I paired it with the onyx ring and it makes it even more stunning
"
"I bought rings and earrings from this shop and love everything!!! Amazing workmanship and so beautiful! Love it!
"
"Was so surprised when I saw it!!!
Love it and let fit is perfect!
Will be ordering again from you!
Awesome!!!!!!
"
"beautiful
"
"Beautiful ring; just as described and fits perfectly! Thank you!
"
"Absolutely BEAUTIFUL rings. i ordered two. i actually didn‚Äôt know my ring size so i just guessed lol. but they fit perfectly! probably my new favorite accessories!
"
"so obsessed ! it‚Äôs so cute and dainty will definitely be ordering again !ü§ç
"
"The ring is beautiful and fits perfectly! I bought the malachite because green is my boyfriend's favorite color and it reminds me of him when we're apart. It is exactly what I was looking for. Thank you so much!
"
"i couldnt figure out how to change my address but alicia was very helpful and super kind and was able to change it for me! they also responded quickly! THE RINGS!! they are beautiful, it fits perfectly and doesnt irritate my fingers when i wear them! its the perfect fit! could never say anything bad about them, i love them (:
"
"Fits perfectly on my middle  finger and fills comfortable. I always wanted to own moss agate ring and it's gorgeous. Love it. Thank you so much.
"
"This ring has beautiful variations within the stone. It looked just like the image on line and fit to size. I love it!
"
"Pretty!
"
"Beautiful jewelry here. This birthstone agate ring was perfect. My girlfriend loves it, the price was right and delivery was speedy. 5 Stars! Recommended.
"
"This ring is, of course, not the real deal. But, no one will guess! I wear it with a band of real white gold, real diamonds and real sapphires. If you really study the silver/gold you can‚Äôt see a difference because the bands are thin. The stones are very realistic. I love the silver work on the underside of the ring. No one sees it but me but I know it‚Äôs there!
I got the ring super fast all the way from Israel.
I am sure all their jewelry is perfect like this ring. I will be buying from here again.
"
"Stunning love it!!! Shipping isnt bad at all, I have gotten about 10 rings now because I jut love all of them! Much prettier in person too
"
"I‚Äôve had this on my ‚Äúloved list‚Äù for quite some time....finally took the plunge & purchased it as a birthday gift for myself, moonstone is my birth stone.

I absolutely LOVE it....it looks beautiful on and it arrived quicker than expected. 
Beautiful quality.....‚ù§Ô∏è
"
"This ring really blew me away! I‚Äôm beyond happy and will definitely order again! 10/10 service and quality.
"
"This is a really pretty ring but it pinches  I‚Äôm a size 71/2 and thought it would be comfortable. It‚Äôs so lovely I‚Äôm keeping it
"
"I loved this ring so much I bought the 1st in rose gold the 2nd in Bronze and then a beautiful green cameo necklace just because the service was so great. THANKS again. CRJohnsonLim
"
"It is an absolute must have. I have recieved so many compliments in the short time I've worn it. I am highly recommending Ragtrader if you want a classic but girly look.
"
"Great customer service!!! The ring is beautiful and can stand the test of time!!
"
"Absolutely stunning. Using this in place of my engagement ring for daily use. Worth every penny. Thank you!
"
"This ring was perfect. My fianc√© loved it I was a little difficult changing order after ordering but she changed everything I needed. This was amazing!!!
"
"Beautiful ring!  The band is lovely gold and thin and the stone is unusual and beautiful.  My daughter loves this!  Thank you!
"
"I just received my ring today and I ADORE it! I had a huge herkimer a few years ago, but the stone fell out of the setting and I lost it. I've been sad about it ever since. This replaces it! It has that quirkiness and beauty I love about herkimers. The size is perfect--it's not overstated but still stands out. It also fits perfectly with my wedding band, which happens to be two cat ears that perch perfectly on either side of the stone.
"
"It‚Äôs so beautiful! Thank you so much. 
I have small hands but this is adjustable so it fits well! It even arrived really quickly, which considering the current lockdown is amazing.
"
"Beautiful and super comfy. The crystal was a little loose but I just added a little glue to the base and it was as good as new! üíóüíó
"
"Thank you!! I love them. üíñ
"
"Arrived fairly quickly and the quality is amazing! The ring is a little too big for me but I love it! Would highly recommend!!!
"
"Fabulous quality and very fast shipping - thank you!
"

La bague en elle m√™me est extr√™mement minutieuse et est √† mon sens encore plus belle qu'en photo. Je n'ai eu que des compliments pour le moment!

"
"gorgeous ring, excellent craftsmanship - for as far as it had to travel, the package got here relatively quickly!
"
"very beautiful ring !
"
 
"I sent a piece of lace from my wedding dress to have made into a custom ring and all I can say is Wow!! I absolutely love it! the ring turned out so well and I love how it looks and feels. It's something unique and precious to me that I'll always cherish. Customer service was amazing and shipping speed was great. I'll definitely be ordering more rings in the future. Thank you so much!!!
"
"My two lace rings were so perfect and lightweight..... thank you so much!!!!
"
"I really like this ring, and the more I wear it, the more I like it. It feels like a hug on my finger. Sadly, the lace doesn't show up well on my skin tone, and wasn't finished the same on both sides of the ring. So one side is cloudy and the other side is clear. I look forward to ordering more resin rings in the future!
"
"This ring is amazing I just went with my normal ring size and it fits perfectly definitely purchasing  again!
"
"It took a while to get to me but I understand that is due to the unprecedented times. That being said, I was counting the days until I received my ring and the wait was worth it! Beautiful ring, beautifully done! This isn't my first time purchasing from this shop and it won't be my last!
"
"Stunning! I absolutely love my ring! It was so worth the wait that it took to arrive. Its delicate and classy and a great way to showcase my babies names on it. I am also very impressed with the attention to detail with the packaging. The special touches that were included in my order were a pleasant surprise.  Thank you!!!
"
"Absolutely obsessed! This picture does not do it justice!
"
"It finally came! I ordered this item in April and omg it‚Äôs perfect! So beautiful! The packaging was very thoughtful as well. 
The shipping did take a long time. But I reached out to the shop and they were very helpful. 
Thank you for giving me such a beautiful ring! 
I will be ordering from your shop again!
"
"I recieved the ring in a timely fashion and in an adorable box! The band is sturdy and so is the setting! It also came with a little card telling about the spiritual propterties of the stone which I loved! I bought it for my mom and it is the most breathtaking shade of green. I could not be more happier with this purchase, I've already got another ring on the way. ??
"
"This ring is beautiful ! Just simply amazing , I can honestly say I am a HAPPY CAMPER üíï also the customer service is incredible ‚ú®  the owner is super understanding, kind & quick to answer your messages! Definitely buying from her again & telling all my friends ! Thank you so much ! You are truly 1 of a kind
"
"Bellisimo!! La entrega perfecta!! Muchas gracias!!!
"
"Fun and unique ring! I liked that I knew it would be unique and I did not know exactly what the shape would be until it arrived. Nice packaging!
"
"I ordered 3 rings, and this was my first purchase. Shipping was a bit slow, took a little over 2 weeks and I was SO impatient lol but I know times are ~rough~ so it was understandable. But the rings!!!!! I‚Äôm so excited I love them all! I was a bit unsure about how they‚Äôd fit but they are perfect. Thanks so much, will definitely purchase from here again!
"
"Love love love! I bought this ring because it‚Äôs my birthstone and it‚Äôs so pretty üòç this is my 6th purchase in 2 weeks, I am obsessed with these rings üòÇ
"
"Second order from this seller! I got the large Herkimer diamond ring first and was in love! Got the moonstone for my birth month and I‚Äôm so happy with both my purchases! Beautiful rings and I love that I can stack them! Also love the fast shipping! Plus the box is super cute!
"
"I am absolutely in love with these rings. The price is perfect and the quality is AMAZING. I will be purchasing more! Thank you <3
"
"I love how delicate and intricate this ring is! I will admit, I had a hard time puzzling it together at first (THANK YOU for sending it with instructions! I couldn't have done it without them) but now that I've had it for abut a month, I am really good at putting it together. I enjoy taking it off and watching people struggle with it. Love love love this ring.
"
"absolutely lovely ring!!! demi shipped it out on time, even after I put in the wrong size‚Äîi should‚Äôve  gotten a 5 1/2 when i accidentally chose 5 3/4 instead--she was more than happy to change it for me (i ordered it on december 7th and she shipped it on the 16th in time for the deadline for christmas shipping). it ended up taking a little while longer to get here due to the holiday season and shipping delays but no fault to demi at all (it finally got here today, on january 2nd). i‚Äôm so excited to wear it because of how pretty and unique it is! take note: there‚Äôs a learning curve for the puzzling part of the ring, but the instructions that come with it are super helpful! definitely recommend this ring and this shop‚Äîi might be back in the near future myself! :)
"
"I love this ring! Although it is big for me, I wish I got a smaller size. It just fits on my thumb and it's still a tad loose. Other than that, it's amazing.
"
"This ring is so delicate! Very beautiful! It's been a while since I owned a puzzle ring, so my fingers were clumsy and putting it back together was a bit tricky, but I'm sure I'll get better at it with practice. Love it!!
"
"When I found out my third godbaby was on the way, I struggled to find a sleek 3-stone ring that wasn't tacky or stingy with gem size... until I came across MielaJewelry! I've been (not so) patiently anticipating the arrival of my order, so I booked it to the mail box when I got a notification that it was delivered. Her work is absolutely beautiful! It definitely lives up to my expectations. I'm incredibly happy with my purchase! 

Metal ordered: Silver
Gems ordered: January*, October, April

*I needed months July, October, and April. I read reviews that July is more pink than red. Since October is pink, I wanted to make sure the first gem is distinctively ""red"" next to it. I choose January in place of July on a whim. I'm glad I did! The red color is deep but brightens beautifully in the light. See photo for reference.
"
"This ring is sooooooo pretty!!!  It met my expectations and more.  I am so happy with my purchase.  Highly recommended.
"
"It‚Äôs so pretty I had to guess my ring size and it fit perfectly! I got my birthday and my boyfriends birthday and our anniversary on it. I love it so much I‚Äôm already wearing it! A little darker than expected but overall super cute ü•∞
"
"I love my mother's ring! It is so pretty!! I am very happy with my purchase. I just bought another ring!!
"
"Any question I had they answered right away! Even though my estimated shipping was like 2 weeks away it came within the week! Absolutely love love this ring! Beautiful and dainty, not like the bulky birthstones rings you see on Amazon! There are 6 children in my family so to be able to put me and all my siblings birthstones on one ring that was so great because they all fit and it looked so perfect! I ordered 2 rings in gold and they came out so gorgeous! Really really love them!!!!
"
"Stones are larger then I thought.  Beautiful colors.  Band is a little skinny.  Overall I really love my new ring!
"
"The ring is everything I could ask for! My great grandmother, grandmother and mom all have mother‚Äôs rings! We scoured Etsy finding the right one and this one kept catching my eye! After many years of infertility and heartbreak we finally added our last and final baby to our hearts which enabled us to buy my own mother‚Äôs ring! The durability is great and the stones are beautiful! I am forever in love with my ring!
"
"Just stunning! I love it so much and will wear it every day! it has mine and my partners birthstones either side of our little girls. She loves it just as much as we do
"
"I absolutely love this ring! The tourmaline stones are bigger than I was expecting making me love it more. The quality is great, it arrived quicker. Would shop again and have been recommending seller.
"
"I am so very pleased with my ring. It‚Äôs absolutely beautiful and working and communicating with GemFormingStudio could not have been easier. They are kind professional, courteous and very patient. 
There was an issue with shipping in that I ordered my ring in January and by March it still hadn‚Äôt arrived. They were very accommodating and offered to send me a second ring at no charge. The second ring arrived within just a couple of weeks ...followed the next day by the first ring!
I was terribly embarrassed and contacted Anushka immediately. Again she was kind, patient  and accommodating and we worked out the payment for the second ring with no problem.
Both rings are absolutely beautiful. My only advice with ordering from GemFormingStudio is be patient. Your jewelry will be beautiful and worth waiting for.
"
"Such a comfortable ring, looks just like the picture, used clear nail polish on the inside which keeps my finger from turning green and get lots of compliments.
"
"The gems are a bit darker than in the picture but I absolutely love this ring.
"
"I love this!!! So pretty, dainty & feminine. I chose the sapphire stone in a silver setting & in a small size to wear on my pinkie. I am very pleased with this purchase!
"
"I absolutely love my ring! IdaJewelryDesign made it perfectly for me! And the size is true! I did order a ruby and this jem looks a bit pink, but it is still beautiful regardless. Even the little pouch it came in was cute.
"
"I am so overjoyed, even though shipping took a while, it was so worth the wait, it looks even better in person and is so beautiful!
"
"This was exactly as I hoped it would be and I love it. I had been looking for a November birthstone ring but wasn‚Äôt able to find something that I really liked until I came across this ring. I like that the color is more muted and not super bright. It‚Äôs so delicate and beautiful. I had some questions before ordering and Ida was so helpful and quick to respond.
"
"Love my engagement ring. It really matches my relationship with my husband and the universe. Thank you
"
"I adore my new ring. I love dainty jewelry and my birthstone is diamond so this ring is perfect for me. I will definitely be buying from this shop in the future!
"
"This ring might be my least favorite of the several that I‚Äôve ordered from ringcrush. The ring itself is perfect and matches the rest of my rings (all silver) and looks great paired underneath any ring that has a larger stone. I was expecting to love thing ring but I think the grey of the stones is just a touch too similar to the silver and they blend in. I would suggest getting this ring in gold! What you see in the description photos is almost exactly what you receive. 100% recommend and trust this shop
"
"This is the 2nd ring I've bought,  and this one is not set as nice as the last. But I do absolutely love these rings!!
"
"I just had my third child two months ago and wanted a birthstone ring to represent each one. I chose this one because it looked dainty but good quality. I was so excited for it to come and it hasn‚Äôt disappointed me yet! It shipped on time and arrived before the estimated delivery date. The size seems to fit true and the stones seem securely placed. Very happy with my purchase! Colors are for February, July, then January.
"
"This ring is so pretty! It is amazing quality! I am so happy with this purchase! it is absolutely beautiful!
"
"It goes great with my fathers original wedding band (the gold band) My parents have been married 54 years this June. And my grandmothers original engagement ring. She passed away last July at the age of 99.
"
"I love my ring so much. I got February August February for my three kids. I stare at it all the time especially if I‚Äôm missing them. Thank you for sharing you talent with the world.
"
"Absolutely LOVE this ring and her work! This is the second ring I purchased from her! The first was a mother's ring with my two daughter's birthstones which I wear above my wedding band and I just got another one of mine and my husband's birthstones to wear below my wedding band! Her work is beautiful and on time and so reasonable! I could not be happier with this purchase and will definitely be buying again in the future!
"
"Absolutely LOVE this ring! I'm always hesitant buying rings online because  past rings have come larger than advertised. However, Caitlyn has sized her rings truly and perfectly - I was so happy when I wore it the first time!
I've been wearing the ring for about a month now, and it's a sturdy little thing; I've worn it through heavy lifting, landscaping work, and copious amount of laundry and dishes. The stones (June & October birthstones) haven't faded at all in color, and the silver finish remains bright. 
As with any open-gap ring, there's always the risk of it catching on something and bending; when it finally happened to me a week ago, I was able to push the ring back into proper placement (more-or-less) and it still fits great.
"
"It's the cutest!! I got it for my pinky and it looks so nice. It fit me a little big but I improvised.
"
"I could not be more pleased. Ordered this as a gift for myself for Mother‚Äôs Day and I love how dainty and beautiful it is. I got the birthstones of all four of my boys. My firstborns are twins and this dual ring was perfect paired with two singles and then stacked.
"
"I have been looking forever for the perfect ring with my birthstone. Finally came across this beautiful piece - it is everything I have been looking for! Thank you so much for making such a perfect garnet ring. The anticipation for it to get here was well worth the wait!
"
"This sapphire ring is such a simple and beautiful statement piece. Ida was so helpful in helping me figure out my correct ring size which was hard for me since this was my first time purchasing one for myself.
"
"All I can say is wow wow wow my ring is magnificent it looks extraordinary she did a marvelous job I am so happy I love love love my ring‚ù§
"
"Ida!! Thank you soooo much for hand crafting this very special ring. I got it for my lovely mother as a random celebration of the fact that she exists. The stone I requested is light amethyst for any of you out there wondering. My mom is blown away and Im jealous!!!! I might just give in and order one for myself as well. The ring is so crisp and perfect... dainty and elegant. I am beyond impressed. 10/10 recommend!
"
"Came earlier than expected. The ring is beautiful!
"
"It's honestly even better looking in person. I would leave a photo of it, but I'm trying to write this discreetly with my bf sitting next to me. I have it hidden away and am very excited to eventually propose using said ring.
"
"I wear this as a pinkie ring and I love it.  It's delicate, beautiful, and I get lots of compliments on the ring, especially on its uniqueness.
"
"I love this ring! I'd never purchased fine jewelry online and was somewhat hesitant, but I really wanted this particular ring. I was reassured by the high ratings for the company, and then by Lior's helpful communications and eagerness to do custom modifications if requested. It arrived extremely quickly (a few days) despite COVID and the upcoming holiday season. The appearance and craftsmanship are wonderful.
"
"Very fast shipping considering the ring came from Israel. I liked that the seller used Fedex vs the postal service.

The ring is gorgeous! It has incredible sparkle! It is difficult to believe this ring is just 1 carat as it looks like a 3 carat ring. I also like that the band of the ring gets slightly wider in the back. I‚Äôm very happy with my purchase! I‚Äôm wearing it as an anniversary ring.
"
"Love love love love love. The top photo shows the contrast in direct sunlight, and the bottom is inside. Depending on the lighting the grey will be more pronounced. (The colors seen in the bottom photo are from a stained glass window reflecting nearby!) I absolutely love this ring and am so glad we chose to order from Lena. She answered any and every question I had and the ring took only 3 days to arrive once shipped. After spending weeks looking for a salt and pepper diamond, I was thrilled to come across this listing. If you are even considering a salt and pepper diamond, do not hesitate to inquire about this beauty!
"
"So this is my second engagement ring, we got it to match my fianc√©‚Äôs wedding band since his is grey/black with black diamonds + rose gold trim. It‚Äôs so beautiful in person and people love it! 
I put a photo of the 2 ct. salt and pepper ring with rose gold alongside my original ring (not from etsy) which is a .65 center white diamond for comparison. My ring size is a 3.5. The seller was very nice and sent me a video and photo of the diamond she would use.
"
"I can‚Äôt stop staring at my new engagement ring! Honestly it‚Äôs one of the prettiest rings I‚Äôve ever seen. My fianc√© is very proud of it and I‚Äôm a very happy fianc√©e. He says his favorite part is how much I love it. Lena was amazing and patient answering all our questions about fitting it with wedding bands we had from my grandma. She even gave us a little sneak video to help with our excitement (though to be honest it was all my excitement)!  Shipping was incredibly fast! I hear nothing but compliments when people notice my ring!
"
"Even prettier in real life! Love my ring! ‚ù§Ô∏è
"
"This is such a beautiful ring. It took a long time to get here because of covid-19 but it was 1000000% worth it.  I am thinking about getting the silver one as well. I have rather chubby fingers and I got a size 10 and it fit amazing. Really could not recommend enough :)
"
"This ring is perfect, exactly what I was hoping for! I ordered a 6.5 and it fits just right and doesn‚Äôt slip left or right on my hand. None of the wires stick out oddly at all either and the pearls are lovely!
"
"Adi's jewelry is a dream and she is a real artist. So well crafted and simply elegant. Also exactly according to my size ordered. I love my ring!
"
"I love it. I should have went a 1/2 size up, its a tad snug. My mistake not the jewelers. 

Its beautiful. Im super grateful for the mothers ring
"
"Amazing quality!!! Beautiful ring so shiny.  Everything I wanted in a family ring.
"
"Very pretty ring and the quality is great!  I am so excited about this ring!!!
"
"I absolutely love my ring!  Its comfortable and just what I wanted.   Thank you!
"
"AMAZING! I honestly can‚Äôt say enough good things about this ring. I ordered it expecting it to not be that great but it‚Äôs better than I could have expected. The band is very high quality and the stones are beautiful and very pigmented. Overall love love love!
"
"Absolutely gorgeous ring. Very dainty, but still stands out. Stones are beautiful. The ring doesn't feel cheap or like it's going to break. Turn around time and shipping were quick for a custom made item.
"
"I am in love with my ring! Beautifully made exactly to order. This ring is exactly what I was looking for and did not disappoint. I highly recommend buying from this shop. It was made and shipped sooner than expected with no issues! Thank you so much! In the future I would absolutely purchase from this shop again. Will be recommending to friends and family.
"
"Absolutely gorgeous and flawless! I am more than impressed! Exceeded wait time expectations considering that it was a custom order, my specific ring must have been started immediately! Will be my go to shop in the future! Thank you so much!!
"
"Other than a slightly longer shipping time and a snafu with delivery (the delivery service freaked me out by notifying me that the ring was delivered when it wasn't) this ring is absolutely lovely. I feel like I just engaged to myself since I keep looking down at this ring. LOL. I have large hands so this rock looks ok on my hands. I'd probably get a smaller stone if I was a petite person. Anyway, i'm pleased as punch with this purchase. Thanks!
"
"Very pretty ring. Just like in posting, only better. Photo does not do justice. I have worn alone or stacked with others. Very happy and will buy again from candybohojewellry!
"
"Amazing ring! It's far more beautiful than I expected. The shipping was very fast, about half the expected time. Would purchase from this seller again in a heartbeat!
"
"Beautiful ring, love it and it's my birthstone, very happy with it
"
"I love the rings. They are beautiful, I am especially in love with the moon stone ring. I like it in the rose gold the best although I love the silver version as well. I have a mix of rings in rose gold and silver and I couldn't decide which to get from this shop so I bought both and it was worth it ! Thank you!
"
"Absolutely adorable! The ring is so great as a midi ring for me. It is exactly as pictured and is absolutely lovely. Shipping was brilliant and super easy to track. TinyBox is one I will be saving and shopping at again. I also LOVE the little gift you sent. Brightened my day quite a lot. Thank you so much!
"
"LOVE THEM! I‚Äôm so happy with these midi rings. Delicate, sparkly, adjustable, super cool, and I love the tiny box! So cute. Thank you!
"
"I would take a picture but I‚Äôm not a hand model! I feel naked without this ring. I like it because you can fit it to your finger. It‚Äôs so unique and dainty. I‚Äôll be getting more midis. Thank you!
"
"Absolutely gorgeous customized ring. My new favorite piece of jewelry.  High quality and fits perfectly.
"
"The ring is beautiful and size is perfect!  Shipping takes a lot of time, due to it coming from Turkey.  Worth the wait!
"
"Love my accent ring!  The ring is exactly what I expected and it fit perfectly.  Great job.
"
"The ring looks lovely.  I love the delicacy of the design and Alya made it exactly to my specifications.  Package arrived timely.
"
"It is exactly what I wanted.  I have big fingers, so finding a ring that goes to my size is difficult.  This ring is perfect!!
"
"Update #2: I couldn‚Äôt be happier!! The new ring I received is gorgeous. The stones are correct and very sparkly. It fits perfectly. The seller was very nice and understanding. I will definitely buy from this shop again!

Update #1: Seller reached out and is graciously remaking my ring. I am looking forward to receiving it! I will update my review again once I receive it. 

It is a beautiful ring but one of the birthstones was not correct. I reached out to the seller to see how we can correct it.
"
"I absolutely love this ring! It was exactly what I wanted and so far, is amazing quality. Thanks so much!!
"
"The ring is beautiful. Fits perfectly too. So happy with it!
"
"This ring is beautiful. I love it! Amazonite is so gorgeous, I love its properties and the way this ring almost looks like planet earth in a way. Hard to get a picture to do it justice. So happy!
"
"I love my rings!! I wear them every day. Exactly as pictured they are perfect. The rose gold is exactly how I imagined it to be. Thank yoU! super fast shipping
"
"This ring is absolutely gorgeous. Its prettier in person than in the picture. Its amazing quality, thicker and brighter than in the picture, and the stone has beautiful shades of light blue. The ring was super protected in the package too. Thank you so much for you beautiful work, I will be ordering from this shop again and highly recommend it.
"
"Bijou magnifique, travail soign√© qui va tr√®s bien avec mes yeux verts.
"
"This ring is absolutely gorgeous! There was some trouble with shipping and the ring arrived late but that‚Äôs not the sellers fault must be the post office issues with covid. I reached out to the seller who was kind enough to make me a new one since this one took so long to get it. I won‚Äôt be needing another ring since this one just arrived today. I‚Äôm very happy with this ring and it was worth the wait .The ring is a gift for my mother and she will love it. I tried the ring on myself and am in love, this picture doesn‚Äôt do the ring justice of how gorgeous it is. 
I will be purchasing again from this shop in the future. 

Ring size 9 Gold birthstones: March, October, August and January.
"
"I absolutely love my ring!  It is so pretty and very delicate looking.  This ring totally met my expectations!!
"
"Such a gorgeous ring! For reference, I got the diamond (April), amethyst (February), pink tourmaline (October), and citrine (November)! :)
"
"You guys!!! All I can say is ‚ÄúWOW‚Äù I love my ring! It‚Äôs so perfect. The value behind it just makes me smile. Knowing I have my babies birthstones on my ring just makes me so happy. Customer service was out of this world helpful. I can‚Äôt thank you guys enough!!
"
"In love ! It‚Äôs perfect!! Thank you so much! 100% worth the wait üòÅ

"This was a gift for my mom. We no longer live close to her so this was a gift for her to always have close even if we're not. Its pretty bjt engraving can barely be seen. I also requested for my son's name to be engraved on the ring. His name is Aiden and ""Ai"" was the only thing engraved. I spelled his whole name in the instruction notes. This is super disappointing.
"
"Beautiful!!! I get so many compliments on my ring! Very comfortable and the stones shine brightly.
"
"Absolutely beautiful. My mom will love it‚ù§Ô∏è and it came before Mother‚Äôs Day!‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è

"I am always extremely cautious when ordering online out of fear for what I‚Äôm actually going to receive. However, I can genuinely say I love this product. My high school best friend and I ordered these rings with our birthstones in them for while we‚Äôre at college. They are extremely well made. The stones do not appear to be of poor quality either. I also love how dainty they are on my hand. 10/10 recommend.
"
"It arrived earlier than I thought it would. It is great quality and it fits perfectly. I definitely recommend this ring. I have my daughter's and son's birthstones in mine. I love it.
"
"The shipping was amazing‚Äîpurchased on Jan. 27th and I received it on the 31st. 

The ring is beautiful, although not exactly as pictured in the product photo (the stones in my ring are closer together). However, I expected some variation in the space between the stones due to photos supplied by other customers! 

In terms of durability, I have only worn it twice so far but it seems sturdy. 

Overall, happy with my purchase!
"
"Super cute, I have big knuckles so this fit really nice the stones were closer together than the original picture but I like it better that way! Shipping was literally 3 days and I live on an island in Canada(I usually wait at least 1-2 weeks for anything to arrive)
"
"Absolutely gorgeous! There are no words for the beauty of these rings. The Swarovski stones sparkle like crazy in any colour. I ordered Siam, Dark Moss Green, Majestic Blue, Crystal (original, Bella ring) and Vintage Rose. Each shade is better than the other. They are all in the 18x13mm size with a Silver band. I am particularly fond of the original Bella ring as it is one of the best and most affordable replicas I have found. A massive thank you to Kristie for all her hard work!!! It took 5 weeks for them to arrive to the Netherlands (expected due to delays in the post between USA and Europe).
"
"Honestly the best ring I own!!! Completely faithful to the description and photos. It is the best Bella Swan ring replica I have ever come across and I am an expert! This ring is beyond and the fact it is made with Swarovski crystals makes the price even more worth it. Definitely a must have for any Twilight fan!!!
"
"I got the crystal clear Swarovski crystal ring in the smaller size, let me just tell you this ring is GORGEOUS! I love so much and am going to look at her other products just based on how amazing this ring looks! Shipping came in so fast, way faster than I excepted for a small business owner, I thought it was gonna arrive in a couple of months not a couple of days to a week! The customer service was amazing she was so sweet! I highly recommend getting her products! The quality is fantastic!
"
"To say I‚Äôm obsessed is an understatement! I love these rings and truly feel so amazing when wearing them. I have made a few purchases and plan on making more because there are so many colors and each color is beautiful. I got rings with gold, silver, and copper bands and each is stunning. Kristie is so amazing and works extremely hard to ensure you get something you will love! This purchase will not be a regret!
"
"I love my Mother's Ring so much! It's so beautiful! Thanks so much!
"
"I was looking for both a infinity ring and a family birthstone ring on the internet and I stumbled upon this beautiful ring where its a two in one ring combined on your shops store so I ordered mine right away and when I got it in the mail and put on my ring I fell in love with it even more so thank you very much for your business and doing a very nice job on the ring.
"
"My ring arrived earlier than expected and is absolutely beautiful. I love it! The sizing is perfect. It looks and feels like a quality piece of jewelry that I will wear for years to come.
"
"The ring turned out beautiful! I can't wait to give this as a gift. Shipping was fast too. I couldn't be happier with this purchase.
"
"This. Ring. Is. Stunning! I can‚Äôt stop looking at it! I wanted something unique and boho but still sparkly for an engagement ring, and this one is PERFECT! I‚Äôm in love!
"
"The ring is absolutely gorgeous! Due to the situation in the world & with mailing right now I was so surprised at how fast it got here (but I would have understood if it took longer)! The ring is lightweight, very sparkly, and the sizing is so great bc I can never find rings big enough. I‚Äôve been looking for a star type ring for ages and this one is legit perfect! Thank you so much ü§ç
"
"Fell in love with this ring the first time I saw it. The band is thin yet sturdy. The quality is exceptional! I put my rings through alot, and this ring looks as beautiful as the day I received it. It's rarely off my finger, and I have received many compliments on it. I own this ring in two different sizes. It's sparkle and shine is like a little burst of happy! I'd give it 10 stars if I could!
"
"Absolutely love my ring! I love stars! Very simple but beautiful I purchased two different styles & love them both will be purchasing more. Plus I love the personalized note, thanks Laura! And extra surprises in the envelope!
"
"The ring is absolutely gorgeous! I can't wait to see her reaction!
"
"Absolutely beautiful. She loves it.
"
"This was the best experience I‚Äôve ever had with jewelers. They helped me design this ring, patiently sending picture updates along the way. Then a final approval picture. They answered every picky question I had and were so so nice and helpful the entire time. Shipping was very quick! And the ring and quality are both amazing, and the attention to detail down to the packaging was immaculate. I can‚Äôt wait to do another piece with them!
"
"Once again, love by Oh Kuol went above and beyond!! I purchased a custom band from them to go with my engagement ring (also from them!) a few weeks ago. When I saw the first piece, I knew I had to get another to stack on either side of my engagement ring. Vi was once again incredibly responsive and got my custom piece completed very fast! I couldn‚Äôt be happier and can‚Äôt wait to rock my pieces after my wedding!! Highly, highly recommended!!
"
"I originally bought the unicorn tears ring but it didn't really suit me (too dainty for my chubby fingers!!) So I asked to exchange for the teepee ring, that is perfect, I love it! And it fits nicely with another ring I have. Thank you!
"
"Beautiful, subtle ring.  Fits like a dream.  The pink opals blend in with the silver of the ring, and then flash in the sun; so if you're looking for something that's very pretty but not eye catching, this is the ring for you!  Also, one of the only stirling silver rings I own that hasn't left a green mark on my finger!
"
"From the recipient - Changes colors in the sun! Well made. What a surprise! It goes beautifully with my other rings. Blue, red, pink, flashes of opal colors. I've never seen anything like it. 
Would gladly do business again.
"
"I ordered the unicorn tears Opal ring and it is absolutely beautiful. The ring came on time and I will definitely buy from here again!
"
"I am absolutely in love with this ring, not only is it stunning and sparkles so much in the light, but it came so quickly! I needed it for a specific date and Luo even rushed it for me so it would come in time, which I really appreciated! Honestly overall I‚Äôm so happy I chose to buy from here! Hopefully now she says yes lol! ‚ù§Ô∏è
"
"We‚Äôve been intrigued by the idea of alexandrite as the center stone of my engagement ring for a while, but could never find a local shop that stocked it to see its qualities In person. Because of that we were wary of spending $1000+ on something we weren‚Äôt sure of. This alexandrite ring in 14k rose gold was just right! It‚Äôs gorgeous, has a clear color change from amethyst purple to vibrant teal, and literally no one can tell that the side stones are cubic zirconia. I get complements on it all the time. Thank you for a beautiful, unique, and affordable ring!!
"
"The ring is beautiful and it arrived so quickly! Luo sized the ring down slightly (to a 5.75) at my request and it fits perfectly! The alexandrite stone is the perfect size and is what I am used to for my birthstone. It ranges from a deep bluish green to bright purple depending on the type of light you‚Äôre in. My only regret is that I didn‚Äôt choose white gold over the silver metal. It definitely would have been worth the increased price as the ring is exactly what I have been looking for!
"
"A truly lovely work of craftsmanship! Arrived quickly and had a stunning effect upon opening the box. I love the three stone style, but I was torn between Morganite and Alexandrite. I went with Alexandrite, which is my birthstone. The stone is so beautiful and the silver is so bright. For reference I‚Äôm wearing a size 5 and I find the 1.5 ct a perfect size for my finger. Thank you, I‚Äôll certainly be returning for more!
"
"Took a while to receive, but considering it came from Russia and in plenty of time for my wedding, I‚Äôm not complaining. I am IN LOVE with this ring! Thank you so much!!
"
"We used this ring as an engagement ring. We didn't want something gaudy or traditional, while not breaking the bank. And this ring delivered! It was the absolute perfect fit, solidly constructed, and the cubic zirconia is gorgeous. Definitely worth purchasing, can't say enough good things about the ring or seller.
"
"It‚Äôs even more beautiful in person, like the photos don‚Äôt do it justice. I bought it as an engagement ring, I‚Äôm excited and certain they‚Äôll love it when I give it to them
"
"This turned out so beautiful! She loved it! üòç
"
"Its absolutely beautiful.  It is smaller than it looked but i love itüíú
"
"So Beautiful. Thank you!! :)
"
 
 
"So pretty! It was worth the wait. I should have gotten an 8 instead of an 8.5, but it is adjustable. I love it.
"
"I absolutely love my ring! It fits and it's exactly what I wanted. My only complaint is shipping is extremely slow. I know I am in the U.S. But not having a tracking number was really hard. But again, love the ring!
"
"The ring is so gorgeous and well-made! Suzanne was very accommodating with my requests. I didn't want a big overlap so I ordered my ring finger size and opened it a bit more to fit my thumb. It's perfect. Took 4 weeks to arrive Australia. Thank you!
"
"This is perfect! I got an ""in-between"" size (7.25) with garnet and opal and it was absolutely perfect!
"
"Love this ring and get compliments on it all the time but it took forever to get to me, which made me feel as though I was getting scammed.
"
"This ring is everything I had hoped for.  Amazing designs to choose from.  Will be purchasing again in the future.
"
"This is amazingly gorgeous! ! I wear it as a pinky ring, and have had a lot of compliments. 
Nicely packed with quick shipping.  Thanks so much.

"Beautiful ring and arrived just as described.  Great addition to my jewelry collection.
"
"Exceptionnelle ! üçÄüå∏
"
"I purchased this for my mom as a Christmas gift and it is more BEAUTIFUL in person (well...Facetime).  The sizing was spot on and she loves!!!.  I can't wait to see it in person.  My mom was over the moon with this gift.  Great jewelry will buy again from them.
"
 
"Magnifique bague üíç
Je suis enchant√©e de cette commande.
La taille est parfaite.

A bient√¥t pour une prochaine commande.
"
"It‚Äôs really a beautiful ring ‚ù§Ô∏è my brother passed away last year so this was all my mom wanted for Mother‚Äôs Day. Thank you so much.
"
"Ring came today and fits perfect, I got the ring with my kids nameso and birthstones, i ordered it the beginning of december. Sadly January 2nd I lost my baby boy :( so this ring coming with his name and stone means more to me then anything.. thankyou
"
"I love my birthstone ring.  It is exactly what i was looking for.
"
"Excellent Service. Beautiful rings. I ordered customized rings and it was made with love and quality. Super fast shipping. Thank you.
"
"This ring is absolutely gorgeous! There was some trouble with shipping and the ring arrived late but that‚Äôs not the sellers fault must be the post office issues with covid. I reached out to the seller who was kind enough to make me a new one since this one took so long to get it. I won‚Äôt be needing another ring since this one just arrived today. I‚Äôm very happy with this ring and it was worth the wait .The ring is a gift for my mother and she will love it. I tried the ring on myself and am in love, this picture doesn‚Äôt do the ring justice of how gorgeous it is. 
I will be purchasing again from this shop in the future. 

Ring size 9 Gold birthstones: March, October, August and January.
"
"I absolutely love my ring!  It is so pretty and very delicate looking.  This ring totally met my expectations!!
"
"Such a gorgeous ring! For reference, I got the diamond (April), amethyst (February), pink tourmaline (October), and citrine (November)! :)
"
"You guys!!! All I can say is ‚ÄúWOW‚Äù I love my ring! It‚Äôs so perfect. The value behind it just makes me smile. Knowing I have my babies birthstones on my ring just makes me so happy. Customer service was out of this world helpful. I can‚Äôt thank you guys enough!!
"
"This ring is just perfect! Exactly what I was looking for. It is high quality not cheap looking at all.  The shipping was fast even coming from Spain!
"
"I love it! it's better than I expected. Very good quality and fit! 
l can't wait every day to wear it!
"
"Fast delivery considering the current circumstances, such a beautiful ring with lovely packaging and sweet notes left along with it!X
"
 
"Amazingly beautiful ring! My future wife loves it! It's Exactly what I expected! The product is the same as the picture, I buy both of the rings on the last photos, they match perfectly! I had a problem with the delivery but the seller take care of it really quickly, I asked many things about delivery, certificates and stuff, she always answer quickly and politely, I strongly recommand, you can trust this seller!
Thank you again for your time and your beautiful work üòä
You made 2 people very happy üëåüòä
"
"Very swift shipping and beautiful quality. The recipient will love this ring, thank you!
"
"Beautiful ruby and gold ring and it was packaged nicely for a gift. My niece will love it! Seller answered emails promptly.
"
"Beautiful, dainty ring; very fast shipping. Thank you!
"
"This ring is beautiful and it fits me perfectly. Thank you!
"
"Nice brilliance to stones well made rapid shipping from Israel
"
"I took off one star because it looked smaller than featured,
so I was disappointed about that. I thought it was well
made. Had I known it was much smaller I wouldn't have
purchased it.
"
"It took about a month to get to me (in California) which is totally understandable what with COVID and being from another country and all. But it was so worth the wait! It‚Äôs so cute and perfect! I‚Äôve been wearing it almost a week now and I like it so much! I haven‚Äôt taken it off to shower or sleep, which I know I should, but I haven‚Äôt had any problems.
"
"I LOVE this ring! I could never have asked for a more detailed or more perfect Mickey ring. It is beautiful beyond words.

Thank you so much!
"
"It was beautifully made and the diamonds in it are very sparkly
"
"I like my ring very much!  I've been looking for a ring like this for years so am very glad to have found a jeweler who made one.
"
"A little different from what was advertised but ok overall. The ring was definitely a size 5 and not 4.75 like I ordered and there is a chip on one of the ‚Äúear‚Äù diamonds that also appears to be of cloudier darker quality
"
"I absolutely love my rings!! We went to several shops but couldn‚Äôt find a wedding said that said ‚Äúme‚Äù. That is, until we stumbled upon this one. I‚Äôve gotten so many compliments on it! The stone changes shades of green depending on the lighting, and goes great with the rose gold. Outside and in bright rooms it‚Äôs a light green like in the seller‚Äôs pic. In dimmer lights it‚Äôs dark like in my pic. Also, for any with slim fingers and are nervous about the shape; this ring is a size 3 3/4. 

The seller‚Äôs communication was great, and the rings arrived within days after being shipped. I highly recommend this store!! Thank you so much for this beautiful set :)
"
"Above and beyond what I was expecting! My significant other wanted a unique engagement ring with a specific stone...I talked to about 12-13 different jewelers who couldn‚Äôt help me before finding capucinne.
Vida was superb in every way! She made the choice easy and not to mention she was incredible with keeping me up with what was going on. Even when a small inconvenience happened I wasn‚Äôt even upset because of how honest she was about everything. Once my ring shipped it got to me 3 days faster than the date was set for...and I was so excited and happy with the quality I proposed pretty much right then and there. My now fianc√© is overwhelmed with what I was able to get! If you‚Äôre looking to buy, this is the place to purchase! Will definitely be coming back for any jewelry in the future! Huge thanks to Vida and everyone else!
"
"I was gifted this for my college graduation and I love it! It‚Äôs true to size, and the stone and setting weren‚Äôt too big or clunky. I got the stacked ring with it too and it‚Äôs perfect to wear separately as well for a more casual look. The only thing is that if you are ordering from the US, you will have to pay a DHS fee (mine was about $130), but it‚Äôs worth it.
"
"Beautiful beautiful bracelet!! Capucinne was in contact with me through the whole process and made everything so easy. She sent me a proof of my bracelet before they started making it and asked for my input on design. I would highly recommend this seller and their work!! I will be ordering from them again!! Thank you Capucinne!!
"
"Beautiful ring, it is very nice.  I love it
"
"Love my ring
"
"beautiful dainty pretty comfortable to wear ring. love it. thank you xxx
"
"Just received it today! Love it!
"
"I received this ring and LOVE it!!  It fits perfectly and the ring is so pretty and well-made!  I really love the stone and that you can purchase other stones to fit within the ring.  I will be purchasing some loose marble stones very soon so I can wear this beautiful ring all the time and still have it look a little different.
"
"Thank you. Its beautiful and the marbel is lovely
"
"Wundersch√∂ner Ring - sehr empfehlenswert! 
Die Bestellung ging schnell und unproblematisch vonstatten; alles war gut verpackt!
"
"Tr√®s bon produit de qualit√©
"
"I love my new ring! It‚Äôs everything I thought and more I haven‚Äôt taken it off.
"
"This ring is SO lovely. Looks exactly like the photo, and is so delicate and boho chic. It arrived a day earlier than anticipated, which is always nice. The packaging was so carefully and artfully done. Will buy more from this seller in the future!
"
"I love my new ring and the packaging was very sweet üòä
"
"Beautiful stone, and very comfortable, smooth feel to the ring. Gorgeous presentation.
"
"This was exactly what I was looking for!! This piece is so dainty and beautiful, gives just the right amount of sparkle! Shipping was incredibly fast! I will definitely be back in the future!!!
"
"Just received this today and its beautiful! Exactly what I was looking for and Young was a pleasure to purchase from. My item was crafted, shipped, and arrived to me very fast - about a week. I plan to make more purchases from this shop in the future. Thank you, Young!
"
"Package went missing for weeks. Turns out it was delivered to the wrong address. Young was SO proactive and understanding. She rocks! And the necklace was absolutely stunning. Exactly what I hoped for. Can't thank young enough! Great customer service and great quality!
"
"This is a beautiful simple necklace.  Love the options from JSV Concept - unique & beautiful.  Young accommodates any adjustments.  I've added this as a favorite shop.
"
"These are phenomenal!!  I'm so glad we ordered these!
"
"Perfect fitting! Beautiful ring. Thanks alot
"
"wundersch√∂ner Ring, Versand ging flott
"
"Beautiful ring!
"
"i received the ring today--for my daughters 18th birthday.  It is STUNNING!!!  The craftmasnship is exceptional and I am very happy with the purchase and know she will be delighted as she picked it out of a ""line-up"" of 20 other rings!!  Thank you!
"
"Absolutely gorgeous! I have purchased this and a stacking ring set from Madelynn and I adore everything she makes. I got this in the brushed finish and the lighting doesn't do the moonstone justice. Thank you so much!
"
"Pardon the messed up nails, I've a newborn so getting my nails done is very low on the priority list. I'm so in love with this ring, it's even prettier in person. Now I need to order a nesting band to go with it because my (now too big) existing one doesn't fit with this at all.
"
"The ring was definitely worth the wait, it is gorgeous--I LOVE it! The ring fits perfect, the craftsmanship is excellent and ametrine stone is amazing. The stone is a decent size and the hammered band is so cool. Highly recommend. Wish I could leave more stars!! Thank you :)
"
"gorgeous item!
"
 
"Everything I wanted and more. It looks perfect with my engagement ring. It was a bit of a challenge to find a wedding band that would work with my oddly shaped engagement ring, but I couldn't be happier! It's thin, but adds so much.
"
"Couldn‚Äôt be more perfect. I picked this out as an anniversary gift to frame my aquamarine and rose gold engagement and wedding bands (made by a different Etsy jeweler). Quick delivery and even more delicate and beautiful than pictured!
"
"I love this ring! It's so well made and fits perfectly. Opals are my favorite so I figured I'd try this ring out since it was such a great price and I definitely wasn't disappointed. It was shipped way before the estimated shipping date and arrived quickly. I would definitely shop here again.
"
"This handmade one of a kind ring is a beauty!  I ordered two of them from you and each ring is individually different and unique. The quality of your product is pristine.

On that note, I just received a 3 ring in the mail. I had only ordered two. What would you like me to do?

Chrissy & Meagan ONeal
"
"My ring arrived today, and I'm totally in love! :) Exactly like on the picture! The opals are so pretty and shiny! I can only recommend it!
"
"Beautiful ring. It came in a pretty little box and has a textured gold band. The opal is beautiful and shifts in the light
"
"Parfait !! Je suis super contente l'alliance est magnifique, la communication avec le vendeur est rapide ,claire. La bague est √† la bonne taille. Les d√©lais respect√©s. Nous allons pouvoir f√™ter nos 20 ans de mariage  et cela sera parfait. Je recommande vivement ce vendeur. üëç
"
"tr√®s belle bague en or jaune, elle ne quitte plus mon doigt depuis que je l'ai re√ßu, super contente et la bague est en or plein et pas comme dans certaine bijouterie ou les bagues sont creuse a l'int√©rieur et se d√©forme tr√®s vite.
"
"Je souhaitais d√©poser un avis pour rassurer toute personne ayant jet√© son d√©volu sur cette bague chat √©gyptien , elle est r√©ellement conforme √† la photo elle est magnifique port√© , je l‚Äôai re√ßu plus vite que pr√©vu , le vendeur est disponible pour toute questions, pr√©cisons √©galement. C‚Äôest une boutique que je recommanderai vivement!

"This is really my precious, mon pr√©cieux!
This small and elegant black diamond tells everyone that I am unique. Many thanks to the Master!

"My ring arrived very quickly even though it is coming from Turkey, and it is absolutely lovely! The quality is very good and it is so pretty and dainty. The gemstones are tiny but it‚Äôs just what I wanted. Really happy with this beautiful ring!
"
"Beautiful ring! Exactly as I wanted it! Couldn't be happier! Picture doesn't do it justice. So pretty. Love it! :) fast shipping!
"
"Beautiful ring and fast shipping. I love it. The colors of the stones aren't as bright as the pictures in the listing but I suspect that's because they are tiny. My stones are November, April, June and July. Thank you for my beautiful ring.
"
"It's perfect. Beautifully crafted. Stones are so pretty and shipping was so fast. Thank you so much!!!
"
"The ring is SO beautiful. It makes me happy to catch it sparkle in the light!
"
"Beautiful rings. Absolutely stunning. I bought them because I liked them but I was also looking for a beautiful selection for my wedding band and engagement ring due to them being stolen and not having the funds to replace them. These look absolutely lovely. One of them I've worn since Christmas and the gold has come off but still stunning.
"
"Love how cute and pretty this ring is! Very fast in dispatching the item too. Would definitely purchase more from this shop in the future!
"
"Shockingly fast delivery and very well made. I have gotten so many compliments from this ring.
"
"After waiting so long to receive this gorgeous ring, I tried it on only for it to be 2 sizes bigger than the ring I ordered. I was so disappointed because it felt like a lifetime I was waiting. I messaged the seller and I‚Äôm waiting for a reply. I wish this ring fit me because it‚Äôs even more beautiful in person than in the picture!
"
"It took awhile but it was sooooo worth the wait! I am in utter awe of this ring. It‚Äôs sooo beautiful and creatively made. It‚Äôs gorgeous and I love it so much!!!
"
"The ring is sooo beatiful u cant not really understand how it is possible to buy emeralds att that price!!! It made all the long way to sweden and i am really happy with my purchase!! Thanks a lot!
"
"Very beautiful and elegant, I feel like a queen while wearing this ring. NOTE: I ordered this one by accident (Columbia emerald is lighter green, similar to lime/kiwi green) so I asked seller to send me Zambia emerald which is darker and more like forest green. I'll be ordering drop earrings soon!
"
"This ring is absolutely gorgeous.  The pictures don‚Äôt do it justice at all.  I bought it as an engagement ring and I‚Äôm that much more impatient to pop the question now so I can see the look on my gf‚Äôs face when she sees this beauty.
"
"Absolutely stunning ring that I chose to be my wedding ring. I haven't worn it yet but I take it out everyday just to stare at it. It's absolutely flawless, shiny, unique, and just plain perfect. I couldn't have asked for better quality. I will definitely buy here again.
"
"Since my husband bought this ring for me, he felt I should be the one to leave the review. It is absolutely gorgeous! I love this ring so much! Pictures do not do it justice. I wanted a tourmalinated quartz for my wedding ring, but what I had found ranged in price from $800 to $1500-way out of our price range. I had put the idea of having one out of my mind and settled for something else. Last week I stumbled across this ring and couldn't believe the price! It is every bit as beautiful as any of the ridiculously high priced quartz out there and the quality is outstanding. Shipping was fast and my ring was packaged safely. I couldn't be more happy. Thank you so much!
"
"The ring is gorgeous and I love the stone! I‚Äôm not accustomed to wearing stone set rings and I wasn‚Äôt expecting it to be set so high since the photos only show a top view. It was pretty easy to get used to a high set ring (as most wedding rings are set like that), but I was worried at first. I ordered a 7 and it fits perfectly. A friend recommended turmulated quartz to help keep calm and minimize negativity and it has served me well, and it‚Äôs so pretty!
"
"Very cute! I'm not sure the stones would pass as real on close inspection but for this price, I don't expect them to. I wanted a simple ring to wear in place of my engagement ring and this is perfect. It looks great with my plain gold wedding band. The quality is great, too.
"
"Decided I wanted to replace my engagement ring with something simple, I truly love it! Although the January birthstone looks orange to me... but other than that this ring now has so much meaning‚ù§Ô∏è Would recommend to anyone looking for something sweet and simple.
"
"I really love it, it‚Äôs the birthstones first my husband, son and myself and it makes me so happy!
"
"Turn out absolutely fabulous! A lot better than I expect. very happy
"
"I bought this ring as a gift and so I will share how happy I am with this purchase and how happy my friend is with this gift! As soon as I had completed my order, the seller contacted me to verify exactly how I wanted the ring. When she was done making it, I received a photo to make sure I liked it before she shipped. I also received a note when it was delivered and when to expect it to arrive. Wonderful service. And the ring is absolutely beautiful, such a finely crafted piece of art! My friend is thrilled that the ring is adjustable and she has shaped it snugly perfect on her pointer finger. The wire wrapping is so cool and the crystal beads catch the light beautifully. We are both so pleased. Definitely recommend ‚ù§Ô∏è
"
"I absolutely love my ring!! I get compliments on it all the time!! Iryna is awesome!!
"
"So in love with this chakra ring! It's absolutely beautiful and the craftsmanship is just stunning. My pleasure to support such a talented artisan. Thanks, Iryna!
"
"Obsessed! So beautiful and comfortable considering the size! Thank you so much!
"
"I‚Äôve wanted a birthstone ring for the longest time (that‚Äôs not too pricey). I love how antique-Celtic  looking this piece is! Unique and one of a kind. Thanks for the speedy delivery!
"
"After ordering this ring, it arrived in about a week. This ring is very unique and presented itself as described.  It is dainty, well made with no sharp prongs and the emerald color is rich.  I bought this as a pinky ring.  In the near future, I would like to order another in a different color.
"
"I love my ring! It is exactly what I wanted. He was quick to respond to my message and made the ring to my specifications.
"
"Omg I am absolutely loving my ring. It fits perfectly. It's stunning.
"
"Beautiful ring that arrived sooner than expected
"
"Very beautiful ring! thank you.
"

"cute. looks just like the pic. recommend!
"
 
 
 
 
"Love, love, love my ring. The ring sizes do seem a little smaller ‚Äî I order a size 8 and it is closer to a size 7. Still fits perfectly, just not on the finger I had purchased it for. I would just recommend ordering up 1/2 a size.
"
"I love this shop their jewellery is so different and amazing and with meaning which I love I bought myself a ring and my daughter claimed it Quick delivery excellent every time Thank you
"
"Very pretty and arrived unbelievably fast! My new favorite piece of jewelry.
"
"Love this ring!! Fast shipping! I‚Äôm getting lots of compliments on it! Cannot wait to make another order!
"
"If I could give her ten stars I would. She has the most excellent customer service. There was an issue with my initial ring. I love this ring so much! Thank you again!
"
"Ring seems to be of good quality, but the stones are so pale in color that they can barely be seen. Overall I‚Äôm happy with it, but wish the colors were a little brighter.
"
"Nice dainty ring.  Shipped fast.  Fits can perfect.  Thanks
"
"Beautiful ring. I love it!!!
"
"It‚Äôs so dainty and perfect! I can‚Äôt wait to have more babies so I can add more to my stack ;)
"
"The rings are beautiful! My wife loved them for Mother‚Äôs Day. The seller also went above and beyond to help get the sizing right. Fast responses and very fast shipping. I would highly recommend!
"
"Beautiful rings, just what I had been looking for. Came in a beautiful display box and fast production/shipping time. Highly recommend!!
"
"I love my ring and I already bought more from this shop. I highly recommend the products.  My only issue is that shipping is slow.  It took 12 days from the time a shipping label was created for me to receive it.  While some of this is the USPS fault, the shop made a label but then didnt bring it to the post office for 5 days.
"
"this ring is absolutely beautiful!! I love everything about it. I am so glad I ordered it. Every time I look at it I smile. Thank you so much for bringing joy to my heart! ‚ù§Ô∏è
"
"I could not love it any more!!! I was so excited to get my first mom ring and it did not disappoint!  Thank you so much, it's beautiful! I love it!
"
"This is EXACTLY what I was dreaming of! It looks amazing with my wedding band. Thank you!!
"
"This ring is absolutely beautiful!! The stones and fit are perfect. I‚Äôve received so many compliments on it already. Would definitely recommend!
"
"I am so happy with my new ring! I bought a ring previously online and it seemed much smaller than the picture. This one was even more beautiful than the picture. I also appreciated the numerous updates about the progress of making my ring and shipping my ring. I knew where it was every step of the way. I highly recommend this jeweler!
"
"This exquisite ring is a milestone birthday gift from my children, that will hopefully become an heirloom for my family, and Robert took the time to perfectly make it just the way I envisioned it to be, featuring the birthstones of my husband and kids. The picture just can't adequately convey how very beautiful this ring really is. Everything about it is very fine and dainty and it is so wonderfully crafted and I have received so many compliments on how lovely it is. Robert was also kind enough to allow me to pester him with questions and each one was answered promptly and patiently, even on the weekend ! It truly has been an easy and enjoyable experience to create the perfect ring, thank you so much for everything Robert, I will wear it with pride every single day.
"
"Absolutely gorgeous! At first I was afraid it would be large and clunky but no! The design is lovely and delicate and the stones complement each other beautifully. Some rings with so many stones can appear gaudy but not this one! Simply stunning and well worth the wait. I can't wait to see my so's face when I propose with this ring they're going to love it!
"
"I had been dreaming of an emerald ring for years. I wanted a ring that reflected the things I find most visually compelling: royal and aristocratic portraiture, period dramas, palaces, castles, and stately homes. There are some fabulous rings out there, but they do not necessarily reflect the sense of historicized grandeur I craved.
I stumbled on Robert's shop quite by chance and fell in love with this ring.
It is now in my possession, and it is everything I dreamed of and more.
Throughout the process, Robert has been most kind and attentive. I will definitely be buying more treasures from his jewellery shop.
"
"I was so surprised bi this ring, it is actually even prettier in real life. Super comfortable, great quality. Thank you SO much!
"
"This is my second purchase from Olizz Jewelry and it didn't disappoint! Beautiful gold ring with the evil eye in the center. I love that it can be adjusted and the craftsmanship is amazing. Thank you for another beautiful piece!
"
"The ring fits perfectly on my pinky finger. Easily adjustable and comfortable. Style is just as pictured. I absolutely love it!!
"
"Beautiful ring. Love that it's adjustable. The evil eye is just a little smaller than pictured. And I received this from Greece in a matter of days! I recommend this shop for lovely jewelry.
"
"Very nice shop! I would recommend!
"
 
 
 
"Beautiful ring. I wanted to change the sidestones and Ivan was such a pleasure to work with, sent me pictures of the possible stones and even of the ring while working on it. It was such a wonderful experience and I am beyond happy with the result, the ring is just perfect. I highly recommend this seller.
"
"it's a beautiful ring and she loved it! Got here before Christmas so I'm good
"
"Beautiful ring, exactly as pictured and fast secure shipping. Thank you!!
"
"This is a truly beautiful ring, so beautiful I'm having a hard time coming up with the right words to do it justice!  Ivan is clearly one of those rare artists who can see into the soul of a stone and then create a setting for it that makes it sing.  He was able to re-size the ring to fit my slightly odd quarter-size perfectly, and the package arrived safely at my west-coast USA home with lightning speed.  I couldn't be happier with my purchase. It's one of the most exquisite pieces in my entire jewelry collection.
"
"Lovely amazing unique and gorgeous Rainbow ring !!! If you're on the fence about it, don't be. You won't regret. I went to Walmart to size my finger and it was spot on with this company. A nine at Walmart was a nine from this shop. The saffires were in the correct color order for us rainbow snobs. :) Thank you!! I love it!!
"
"Beautiful thank you.
"
"Firstly, Trent was so helpful, his customer service was great. Secondly, the delivery was flawless, even arrived earlier than expected despite the Royal Mail problems in the uk at the moment! And lastly, I‚Äôve wanted this ring for years and finally decided to treat myself to it! It was worth the wait, it‚Äôs so beautiful. I worried it would be garish but it really isn‚Äôt one bit. It‚Äôs very tasteful. I love how the band isn‚Äôt thin too. It‚Äôs been made extremely well and i love wearing it so much!! Thank you üòä
"
"Beautiful, colourful ring. Trent was very patient and nice when I asked him for close-ups of the ring - he sent me a video instead so I could see the details and all angles! If I had to, the only thing I'd change about the ring is the green sapphires (not a fan of that shade of green, and set in silver it kinda looks grayish), but I knew that going on. Inspite of the green being a dull olive, it is a beautiful piece of jewelry. The sapphires are faceted so perfectly, they sparkle under any light source - even in sunlight!! I love rainbows, and this is my own personal rainbow on my finger! I'll definitely be back for more.
PS: Shipping was fast, even during covid (ordered 03/19/21 received 03/29/21). Initially when I saw the ring it said it didn't ship to Canada, so I messaged Trent and he was able to fix that. Thank you!!
"
"LOVE this purchase! The wait was long but worth it, and it actually arrived early within the stated shipping window. The size is exactly as-ordered. One of my stones is a little darker than was pictured, but well within the bounds of expected variation. I am super happy with the purchase and would definitely recommend this shop.
"
"My husband proposed with the matching marquise opal ring two years ago and I've been SO excited to get this matching band, and after all that buildup it's even better than I'd hoped. They fit together perfectly and comfortably, the staff were so polite and helpful, the ring arrived sooner than expected, and I've lost track of how many strangers have complemented them! ‚ù§Ô∏è I love them endlessly, thank you MinimalVS
"
"Wundersch√∂ner Ring!
"
"Both myself and my partner could not have been happier with the ring. The green sapphire is beautiful, just the right shade and looks so different depending on the ambient light. It's impossible to get bored of it! Choosing the right engagement ring is a huge decision, but the team were helpful and supportive throughout the process and gave me plenty of confidence. I would highly recommend this store to anyone hoping to pop the question!
"
"I have been looking for over a year for a unique stone ring.  This emerald ring is everything I was looking for and more.  I knew I wanted it for my middle finger and requested in my note that the stones be bigger.  I was so pumped to see my note acknowledged and followed through on!  I got this ring this afternoon and can‚Äôt stop staring at my hand.  I actually turned around and ordered a mystery box of rings!  I will a loyal customer for life!!!
"
"I love love this ring so much! It's exactly what I was looking for in an emerald ring. I adore how the stones are clustered together making them look one continuous bar. It looks very dainty on the finger yet incredibly secure. Elizabeth was kind enough to warn me of possible delays while shipping overseas, which I took note and thanked her. Then proceeded for the long await. It turned out that I was incredibly lucky and my order arrived within just a couple of weeks, which was a wonderful surprise. Thank you all!
"
"I officially have a crush on ring crush! My first purchase was dainty ring with a citrine stone about 1 month ago. I was so impressed with that ring that I've bought 3 more since, including this triple raw emerald ring which I love! Everything I've bought looks at least as nice in person as it does online. 

Also, Elizabeth is extremely helpful and responsive and makes sure that she keeps you updated on the status of your order.
"
"LOVE!!! Such a beautiful ring and true to size. 

I have the citrine and raw emerald rings. Definitely will buy more!
"
"It is beautiful just like I pictured. Fit my finger perfect. It is my birthstone and my husbands. Thank you very much, love it.           Evelyn
"
"Absolutely perfect! I get so many compliments on it!!!
"
"My ring looks great--I am very pleased with how it turned out!
"
"The ring is perfect, thank you so much!
"
"I‚Äôm in love with my ring!! The design is unique compared to other birthstone rings I‚Äôve seen. Fits perfectly and the stones are so vibrant.
"
"This ring is even prettier than I imagined. I LOVE IT!!!
"
"Really beautifully done! I‚Äôm so happy with my ring.
"
"I absolutely love my ring!! My husband got it for me for Mother‚Äôs Day because I wanted a ring with all of our birthstones and it‚Äôs perfect! Thank you! üíó
"
"I can‚Äôt stop staring at my new engagement ring! Honestly it‚Äôs one of the prettiest rings I‚Äôve ever seen. My fianc√© is very proud of it and I‚Äôm a very happy fianc√©e. He says his favorite part is how much I love it. Lena was amazing and patient answering all our questions about fitting it with wedding bands we had from my grandma. She even gave us a little sneak video to help with our excitement (though to be honest it was all my excitement)!  Shipping was incredibly fast! I hear nothing but compliments when people notice my ring!
"
"So this is my second engagement ring, we got it to match my fianc√©‚Äôs wedding band since his is grey/black with black diamonds + rose gold trim. It‚Äôs so beautiful in person and people love it! 
I put a photo of the 2 ct. salt and pepper ring with rose gold alongside my original ring (not from etsy) which is a .65 center white diamond for comparison. My ring size is a 3.5. The seller was very nice and sent me a video and photo of the diamond she would use.
"
"Love love love love love. The top photo shows the contrast in direct sunlight, and the bottom is inside. Depending on the lighting the grey will be more pronounced. (The colors seen in the bottom photo are from a stained glass window reflecting nearby!) I absolutely love this ring and am so glad we chose to order from Lena. She answered any and every question I had and the ring took only 3 days to arrive once shipped. After spending weeks looking for a salt and pepper diamond, I was thrilled to come across this listing. If you are even considering a salt and pepper diamond, do not hesitate to inquire about this beauty!
"
"Words can‚Äôt even describe how impressed I was! At first I was skeptical ordering a ring without seeing it in person. However I‚Äôm so glad I did! Lena was amazing throughout the whole process! My boyfriend and I picked out this ring together as my engagement ring, but has not yet proposed, so waiting to officially wear it! Highly recommend this shop! They were very flexible with payments and doing custom sizing. Couldn‚Äôt have had a better experience!
"
"Love this ring! Looks just like the picture. I was afraid the sapphires would be too dark to see the color but they are not. I love how dainty it is. I was surprised how fast it came!
"
"Absolutely lovely ring. I would definitely buy from this seller again - maybe even the same ring in a different colour!
"
"I love my ring. I can't wait to wear it on my wedding day and for the rest of my life. This is what my wedding ring is. I will definitely order from you again.
"
"Incredibly beautiful ring! The tiny sapphires are stunning, it looks really well made so I'm not concerned about them falling out - the silver looks pushed over the top of the gems to keep them safe. Came with a certificate with what the stones are (and metal) which was a lovely extra!
"
"So beautiful & thank you very much & God bless you allüíùüíùüíùüíù
"
"Absolutely love it. Its stunning, exactly what i wanted :-) thank you. Will definitely be ordering again!
"
"Absolutely beautiful, exceeded my expectations!
"
"My mom is soooo happy! This is such a great gift! It came quickly and perfect! So dainty and pretty!
"
"love my ring, it is just as pictured. I will say that the metal is probably super cheap because it turns my finger very green, and the Ruby's have also chipped off a little bit, but still love it!
"
"So happy with my ring that I bought two more!
"
"This ring is perfect! Quality is amazing. Looks exactly like the picture. I am blown away! I love it! Thank you so much. I will be buying more from you and recommending your shop to others!
"
"life my ring, it is just as pictured.. however the metal isn't the most quality, it turns my finger very green almost immediately, but I still love it!
"
"I ordered a birthstone ring of me and my boyfriend. I‚Äôm so pleased of how this ring turned out! It looks prettier in real life than a picture. Although I should‚Äôve got a size up, I‚Äôm so happy of how my ring turned out and I‚Äôm still able to wear it perfectly fine. I‚Äôm incredibly happy I have a ring that reminds me of my boyfriend. And I can wear it everywhere I go. If you‚Äôre thinking about buying this ring, don‚Äôt hesitate, just buy it! it‚Äôs so worth the money. It‚Äôs so simple and gorgeous and I‚Äôm so happy I got it! ‚ù§Ô∏è
"
"It‚Äôs absolutely perfect!!!!! I‚Äôve always wanted an anniversary band but never could find exactly what I was looking for. This allowed me to personalize a ring exactly how I wanted it. I have stones to represent myself, my husband, our wedding and the birth of our son. Will definitely be purchasing from here again. ‚ù§Ô∏è
"
"I love this ring so much! It is even prettier in person. Shipped fast!
"
"Love my new ring! Easy order process, fast shipping and the quality is awesome! Ring came in a ring box and not just a package which made it even more personal! Can‚Äôt wait to place my next order!
"
"The ring came in quickly and was so pretty! Exactly what I expected!
"
"Shipping was quick when I did arrive it was absolutely stunning 10/10 would purchase again!
"
"I really wanted to love this ring as it was a Mother‚Äôs Day present to myself. After 2 hours of wearing it my finger was green and the ‚Äúrose gold‚Äù had turned to silver. I would not recommend the price for costume jewelry unless you just want to look at it and not wear it.
"
 
"**Update** I finally received my ring. It is absolutely beautiful and good quality. Perfect size, not big and bulky, fits comfortably on my finger. The colors are exactly as advertised.  

Shipping was really slow but if you are willing to wait, it's a beautiful piece of jewelry.
"
"I LOVE this ring. Exactly what it showed online. Fit is perfect. I gave it a 3 for shipping because we had an issue with the shipping. But their CS was excellent and even though it took a while, I did finally get it and I am in love with the ring. And they switched shipping companies so hopefully nobody else has any issue with that.
"
"I LOVE the ring I ordered. The quality far exceeds the price.
*My order took quite a while to get to me which was due to the shipping company, not the vendor. They shipped quickly on their end. They were also very helpful to deal with!
"
"This is such a beautiful ring! I wish it had more copper in the stone but I understand that not all stones are the same and it‚Äôs still gorgeous. Thank you, Seller.
"
"Cette bague est une merveille ! D√©licate et gracieuse. La pierre de lune est ravissante. Envoi super rapide (command√©e mercredi soir, re√ßue samedi matin). Merci beaucoup !!
"
"It's positively radiantly beautiful!
"
"Very fast envoice. Excellente communication and very pretty ring.. magnifical !! Thanks very much.
"
"I love this ring. This is such a beautiful ring. It feels delicate and the stone is beautiful.
"
"My ring is even prettier in person! And it fits perfectly. I love it so so much. I can‚Äôt stop showing it to everybody. I‚Äôm going through an awful time in life, I‚Äôve been looking for something to replace where my wedding rings were. This ring for my kids fills that spot perfectly. Thank you so much.
"
"I love this ring. I got my husband, myself and my newborns birthstones! Once item was shipped, I received it in 3 days!  The packaging was super cute. Ring fits well. I definitely recommend.  Thank you!
"
"What a beauty! I was so excited to receive my one of a kind ""Grandmom"" ring. It came in a package that would easily rival any high end jewelry store. Beautifully crafted. Fits perfectly. I've received so many compliments and I'm so proud to represent the 3 generations of my family tree in such an adorable way. Easy communication. A seamless transaction. Shop with complete confidence. I've already ordered 2 more. üòÅ Thanks so much!
"
"I absolutely love my ring. I did the silver and my babies are June,October, and November so it even makes for a perfectly girly ring with the colors of the birthstones. Very Happy!
"
"LOVE LOVE THIS RING!!

The amethyst stones beautiful colors and they have a beautiful sparkle in them it is so awesome. The shipping was a bit of a challenge but then it might be because I‚Äôm from Alaska. I would not hesitate to buy another ring from them. Beautiful beautiful Marksmanship!! thank you
"
"Sooooooo in love with this ring! I can't still looking at it! A nice little gift to myself xoxoxo
"
"I love this ring. It's more beautiful in person. The size is perfect and the design is unique. Delivery took the time that was specified. The seller was available to answer questions, which he did in promptly manner. Will definitely buy again and recommend to family and friends.
"
"Oh my goodness, this ring is perfect. Just the right size for my hand (I wear M gloves). I just keep looking at it. The setting is beautiful and sets off the stone gorgeously. I can't praise this enough!!
"
"Love this piece, I wear it every day. ‚ù§Ô∏è
"
"Once again, love by Oh Kuol went above and beyond!! I purchased a custom band from them to go with my engagement ring (also from them!) a few weeks ago. When I saw the first piece, I knew I had to get another to stack on either side of my engagement ring. Vi was once again incredibly responsive and got my custom piece completed very fast! I couldn‚Äôt be happier and can‚Äôt wait to rock my pieces after my wedding!! Highly, highly recommended!!
"
"This was the best experience I‚Äôve ever had with jewelers. They helped me design this ring, patiently sending picture updates along the way. Then a final approval picture. They answered every picky question I had and were so so nice and helpful the entire time. Shipping was very quick! And the ring and quality are both amazing, and the attention to detail down to the packaging was immaculate. I can‚Äôt wait to do another piece with them!
"
"My fianc√© purchased my engagement ring from this Etsy shop. I found the band I wanted to sit underneath the engagement ring and decided to contact the same shop so they‚Äôd fit perfectly. I am OBSESSED with this custom ring! From step one of contacting this shop to the final receipt of the product, the experience was amazing and professional! They responded quickly to any and all questions that I had. They sent 3D images of what the ring would look like so I could confirm it was what I wanted. The ring was produced and delivered in under two weeks. The quality is gorgeous and it is EXACTLY what I asked for. I love this ring and I love this shop, 10/10; highly recommend!!
"
"a perfect engagement ring, which thanks to the team was resized and delivered back in quick time. Thanks again all.
"
"Fast shipping, Great product would definitely buy again.
"
 
"I absolutely love my rings!! We went to several shops but couldn‚Äôt find a wedding said that said ‚Äúme‚Äù. That is, until we stumbled upon this one. I‚Äôve gotten so many compliments on it! The stone changes shades of green depending on the lighting, and goes great with the rose gold. Outside and in bright rooms it‚Äôs a light green like in the seller‚Äôs pic. In dimmer lights it‚Äôs dark like in my pic. Also, for any with slim fingers and are nervous about the shape; this ring is a size 3 3/4. 

The seller‚Äôs communication was great, and the rings arrived within days after being shipped. I highly recommend this store!! Thank you so much for this beautiful set :)
"
"My mom loved her ring! It fits true to size, and it‚Äôs incredibly shiny (so much that it‚Äôs kinda hard to get a good picture of the engravings). The band and engravings were a little smaller than I expected, but overall they were fine! Ryan was great, he had some type of circumstance that messed up the ring timing but he shipped it a bit faster to get here closer to mother‚Äôs day!
"
"I ordered this ring for my daughter for mothers day.  I had some questions about the stones and emailed Ryan who responded very quickly.  I received the ring in about a week and it was beautiful.  It's a very simple ring which is perfect for my daughter.  The stones have great color and the font used for the names make it easy to read them.  I will definitely recommend to others.  Thanks Ryan!
"
"Shipped on time and I absolutely LOVE my ring. It‚Äôs so pretty. Fits perfect and made very well! Love having my kids name on it with their birthstones, and it‚Äôs not too big it‚Äôs just perfect size!
"
"I love my ring! Ryan was quick about answering my many questions and the ring is beautiful!
"
"I have not seen a ring like this before.  I like showing it to others because it‚Äôs amazing how I can switch from one stone to another. Thank you I love this ring.
"
"Love Love Love! This ring is so beautiful, and absolutely worth the wait.

Take note of delivery times, I am in the US, and it comes from Turkey, so it took some time, but as I said, definitely worth the wait!

Thank you so much! 

Will be a customer again!
"
"taille un peu petit mais magnifique produit
"
"Such beautiful ring, fast shipping, thank you üòÄ
"
"It took over a month to deliver but the that's to be expected from shipping overseas. The ring is EXACTLY what I wanted, couldn't be happier. I'm typically a size 5-5.25. I'm wearing it with a rose gold band that's 5.5 that is super snug and this ring was loose. Not too big of a deal, but I'd recommend to order a half size down!
"
"I ordered this ring in silver with one January, one August and two June stones, representing my sons and daughter. It is so delicate and gorgeous!! It fits perfectly!! I can't even express how much I love it. It's adorable and sparkly and delicate and pretty and fills my heart every time I look at it, since it represents my four beloved children. Thank you!!
"
"This dainty delicate ring has held up so well I wear it daily! I paired it with my wedding band and my anniversary band and it's a perfect fit. It has birthstones of my husband my 2 kids and myself. Cutest thing ever. Just what I was looking for. The shopping process was super easy too.
"
"Wonderful quality. Ring is super lightweight and dainty. It‚Äôs perfect for me! Thank you.
"
"Both my opal & amethyst /copper rings are truly stunning. So simple & elegant. I absolutely love them. What packaging!  Quick turn around & they fit perfect. Thank you so much! ‚ô°
"
"I'm so in love with my new ring! It's hard to capture how beautifully the opals glimmer in the light - they're stunning. As an added bonus they were packaged with the air plant Spanish Moss, which is a really clever idea! Alicia is the perfect artist and seller - communicative, timely and clearly puts so much care and craftsmanship into what she does :)
"
"GORGEOUS!!!!! I am in love. Bought 3 to stack and couldn't be happier.
"
"These rings are beautiful! They came out exactly like I hoped for and arrived on time!
"
"I‚Äôm in love with my ring!! The design is unique compared to other birthstone rings I‚Äôve seen. Fits perfectly and the stones are so vibrant.
"
"This ring is even prettier than I imagined. I LOVE IT!!!
"
"Really beautifully done! I‚Äôm so happy with my ring.
"
"I absolutely love my ring!! My husband got it for me for Mother‚Äôs Day because I wanted a ring with all of our birthstones and it‚Äôs perfect! Thank you! üíó
"
"Era mi anillo favorito y se me perdi√≥, lo volv√≠ a comprar y ya vuelvo a tenerlo!! Me encantan los detalles y lo minimalista que es al mismo tiempo. Como siempre, viene empaquetado de una forma preciosa, esta tienda cuida todos los detalles y sin duda seguir√© comprando en ella!
"
"Geeeenau was ich wollte, habe ich hier gefunden :) ich liebe ihn! Er passt wie angegossen, der Versand war schnell und die Verpackung liebevoll und edel :) ich bin begeistert.. danke :)
"
"Took slightly longer than expected to arrive. However, the ring is so cute! It seems like it‚Äôs good quality. Only thing is that the evil eye is a little smaller than what I had imagined, but it‚Äôs still very pretty!
"
"I get so many compliments on this ring. I wear it every day!
"
"Today was our engagement and the first time I got to lay eyes on this ring. It's more perfect than I imagined and am so beyond in love with it!
"
"This was a wonderful experience!!!  I originally inquired about this ring in 18k gold. I wanted to modify the setting, Paul said he can do it. He sent me a video of 3 different stones so I could get an idea of the cut and clarity of the one that would be mine. Of course, I changed my mind, and ended up with a different (larger) stone size as well. 
It‚Äôs so beautiful in person. I can‚Äôt believe it‚Äôs mine. It is an 18 karat 2mm band and a 4.18 carat diamond.  Below is the Instagram post, because the photo of it on my finger won‚Äôt do it justice.

"My ring is so beautiful that I find myself just staring at it! It is everything we were looking for. The packaging that the ring came in made me feel even more special. You'll know exactly what I mean when you order through BestBrillliance. Paul was amazing! He was incredibly responsive to all our questions and made sure we received our package. I couldn't be happier.  We will be looking at bands next.
"
"My husband and I are celebrating our fourth wedding anniversary this year and he surprised me with wanting to upgrade my ring as a gift. The ring is gorgeous! Better than I could have expected. I was updated with photos of the completed ring as well as updates when it shipped. I would highly suggest buying from Best Brilliance. You won‚Äôt be disappointed.
"
"The ring looks gorgeous!
It fits perfectly, the opal is stunning, it everything I wanted üòä

It's really lovely.
"
"The ring showed up in about 5 days after placing my order. Not to say it was rushed at all though, because the ring is amazing and fits perfectly! My girlfriend absolutely loves it and so do her peers. Awesome job all around.
"
"Beautiful ring. I bought it as an engagement ring and my fianc√©e loved it. The delivery was super quick.
"
"Came in very nice packaging and shipped relatively quickly. I am hoping for the price that this ring lasts me a long time, but it's very pretty and dainty. I was very appreciative of the fact there were quarter sizes, as it fits my finger perfectly.
"
 
 
"My ring arrived very quickly even though it is coming from Turkey, and it is absolutely lovely! The quality is very good and it is so pretty and dainty. The gemstones are tiny but it‚Äôs just what I wanted. Really happy with this beautiful ring!
"
"Beautiful ring and so happy that it was available in 8 stones. Sizing was perfect and accurate. This will be a wonderful Mother‚Äôs Day present. Beware it is shipped from Turkey so it might take a bit, mine took 1 1/2 weeks which is not bad. Lovely ring overall.
"
"hello, and i want to give a beautiful and up most thank you for this ring. the craftmanship was great and very beautiful. I received big reviews on this ring, beside i love it. I had to do this because one of the rings i received was straight up garbage. I love silver and these ring are marvelous. I give big thanks for this ring. I will continue to support. Peace Love Happiness
"
"Gorgeous ring but the sizing is a little out. other than that customer service was perfect. delivery was early so perfect.
"
"Beautiful ring. Fits perfectly. Quick delivery. Recommend.
"
"Bought for a young man who adores bling. He will love this extremely blinging ring.
"
"This ring is beautiful.  Even more beautiful than I expected it to be.  Thank u very much!
"
"the ring is beautiful and great quality, impressed with how quickly it arrived!
"
"I am beyond pleased with the ring I received, which I bought for my mom as a gift. The quality was excellent, as was the price which included shipping, and the ring arrived very quickly, despite traveling such a long distance. Great gift for mother's day, birthdays, Christmas, etc. I'll definitely be buying more for myself and other family members!
"
"I can't believe how fast I got my order! And it is Beautiful! Just like the picture!! Love it! Bought it for my Mother in Law for a late Mother's Day gift!! Would definitely recommend this !! Also the owner answered all of my questions and fast response!
"
"Ring looks beautiful, wife absolutely loves it! Thanks for the incredibly fast turn around!
"
"The ring is beautiful-custom ordered a twisted band!  Best customer service I have experienced anywhere in a long time!!
"
"Another beautiful ring! Any time I‚Äôve had questions for Michael, he‚Äôs been very pleasant and helpful. I highly recommend his shop!
"
"Yet another lovely piece - thanks!
"
"My husband proposed with the matching marquise opal ring two years ago and I've been SO excited to get this matching band, and after all that buildup it's even better than I'd hoped. They fit together perfectly and comfortably, the staff were so polite and helpful, the ring arrived sooner than expected, and I've lost track of how many strangers have complemented them! ‚ù§Ô∏è I love them endlessly, thank you MinimalVS
"
"Such a gorgeous and elegant ring, simple yet original. Perfect. I was worried it would not match the picture, but I was wrong. The ring is exactely as presented, though thicker than I imagined. The seller has been responsive and patient and the ring arrived way way sooner than expected. I am absolutely delighted I chose this ring as my wedding ring.
"
"This exceeded my expectations!!! My ring is absolutely stunning & nests seamlessly with my engagement ring (which I bought from another vendor). 
Customer service was impeccable. Quick responses & always willing to answer my questions! 
If you‚Äôre considering purchasing this ring.. let this be your sign to pull the trigger!
"
"Both myself and my partner could not have been happier with the ring. The green sapphire is beautiful, just the right shade and looks so different depending on the ambient light. It's impossible to get bored of it! Choosing the right engagement ring is a huge decision, but the team were helpful and supportive throughout the process and gave me plenty of confidence. I would highly recommend this store to anyone hoping to pop the question!
"
"I bought this to wear with some bullet necklaces i purchased a while back & i am so glad i did! It compliments them so well! I love peacock ore! In the light so many hidden colors pop out at you! Great quality as always!! Love my ring!
"
"Love this ring! It matches well with virtually everything, and it's solidly made. I absolutely love the way the crushed crystal sparkles! Plus, it's super unique - people ask me about it all the time!
"
"Absolutely love the ring! I ordered it in fuchsite and it looks exactly like the photo. I didn't even have to adjust the ring (size 7).
"
"I bought this ring in the malachite crystal and it is gorgeous! Shannon was so good about answering all my questions. I have small, thin fingers so I was worried it would look too big, but it's perfect. I would definitely buy from her again!
"
"My ring is beautiful!! I got 5 stones. My husband's, mine, and our three kids. Very happy with It! Thank you!
"
"This ring is stunning! I love the way it turned out!! So happy with it!
"
"Absolutely gorgeous ring! It is exactly what I wanted. I also love that I was able to order in 1/4 sizes because a 7.5 is too small but an 8 is just slightly too big. 7 and 3/4 is PERFECT.
"
"PERFECTION, I love it! Thanks so much!! Three stones look gorgeous!
"
"Ich habe lange nach einer Ankerkette gesucht die das klassische ‚ÄûKettendesign‚Äú so symmetrisch einf√§ngt wie dieses Armband. Die einzelnen Glieder sind perfekt 
verarbeitet und der Glanz wundervoll.

Das Highlight ist f√ºr mich die besondere Schlie√üe! Ich bin selbst kein Fan vom klassischen Karabiner. F√ºr mich sieht es dann immer zu ‚ÄûStandard‚Äú aus und es dr√ºckt halt auch manchmal am Handgelenk. Aber bei dieser schlie√üe sp√ºrt man gar nichts! Ich habe mit diesem Armband geschlafen, war mit ihm duschen, nichts- es gibt keine M√§ngel.

Freue mich schon sehr auf die Halskette die ich bestellt habe! Super service, super Qualit√§t. Was will man mehr?
"
"Meine Bestellung wurde von Andrey unkompliziert und schnell abgewickelt. Der Ring passt mir perfekt! Die Rosenbl√ºte ist detailreich und wundersch√∂n ausgearbeitet. Die Schw√§rzung befindet sich im unteren Teil der Bl√ºte, dadurch strahlen die Bl√ºtenbl√§tterr√§nder um so mehr. Ich habe f√ºr kleines Geld einen besonderen und wirkungsvollen Ring bekommen, der mir ausgesprochen gut gef√§llt.
"
"The ring is gorgeous and very well made. Andrey is very helpful and you'll get great service if you buy from Fabrior.
Can't recommend enough!
"
"Lieber Andrey,

wir haben lange nach unseren Ringen gesucht und sind nun sehr gl√ºcklich, Deinen Shop gefunden zu haben!! 
Es war einfach alles perfekt! Super freundlicher Kontakt, extrem schnelle Fertigung&Versand und zwei wundersch√∂ne Ringe die wie angegossen passen! Danke f√ºr alles!! :)
"
"I had messaged the seller about this ring in different sizes before, and a year later they followed up to let me know they had more sizes in stock! Great customer service, and the ring is beautiful. My husband loves it!
"
"Beautiful ring, just like in the pics. not too heavy but not too light either, I love it!
"
"Sehr sch√∂ner Ring, durch den Bernstein auch ein Unikat. Ich trage ihn sehr gern. Danke und gern wieder.
"
"True craftsmanship and really the pictures on here don't do it justice
"
"All in all, very happy with it. I do wish the gems were a little brighter. The ""yellow topaz"" for November is very pale, almost white and the ""ruby"" for July is pink (my brother wasn't thrilled to be represented by pink haha!). But, like I said, very happy with it overall.
"
"Ring is just perfect!!  Stones arranged as ordered. Thanks so much!! : )
"
"So beautiful! Well made and the stones are the right color!
"
"Beautiful,  just as described. Thank you
"
"I love this ring! It dainty and beautiful!
"
"so dainty and pretty. love love love it!
"
"Very sweet petite ring looks lovely - arrived quickly and fits perfectly.
"
"I received these beautiful rings two days. They are so cute and dainty. I wore to work they fit perfect. I would recommend others to purchase as well.
"
"Everything is just fine! The ring is made of good quality and looks super cute on my finger! Shipping was really  fast! The shop owner is extremely friendly and very concerned about the customers satisfaction. I absolutely recommend this shop! Thank you so much!
"
"I ordered this ring on 4/26 and it arrived on 4/29! How is that even possible?!
As always, quality is 5 stars. I love this shop!
"
"Returning customer here! Thodoris and Stavroula, a young couple with two daughters, own and operate this shop. I mention that because it is always nice to know who you‚Äôre supporting. 

The gang is extremely effective in their communication, very prompt with their replies and wait! There‚Äôs more; They‚Äôre sending out orders in ridiculously fast paces! Both my rings were made within 24 hours - give or take - and were with me in two business days! I have no clue how they do it! In addition to the positive vibes and the phenomenal customer service their creations look and feel AWESOME! The pictures of the products are very true to what you should be expecting to receive and I dare say the actual thing is even nicer than what is depicted! Guys thank you for the delightful experience :)

"
"Ein toller Ring ! Die Lieferung war schnell und unkompliziert ! Ich werde hier gerne weiter st√∂bern und mir bestimmt nochmal etwas kaufen !
"
"Bague magnifique tr√®s ann√©es 80‚Äò, bien prot√©g√©e dans un tr√®s joli pochon et envoy√©e ultra rapidement. Je suis tr√®s contente, un grand merci!
"
"the ring left me speechless in person - the shine and glow os the blue is stunning. can‚Äôt recommend this business enough!!
"
"Absolutely stunning. I just love it.
"
"This ring is so cute. Great quality, fast shipping. Will buy from seller again :)
"
"Just beautiful and exactly as presented. Just love his jewelry.
Thank you.
"
"Beautiful ring. It is a little bigger than appears on the foto's. Almost more of a men's ring, but no problem if you're a woman and just like big rings ;)
Color an quality seem to be perfect. Beautiful carvings  on the ring.
Shipment was apr. within estimated shippingtime. It took about 2 weeks to send from the US to the Netherlands.
"
"This ring is gorgeous.  Perfect fit.  Received it quickly.  Definitely recommend.
"
"l'anello √® carino e ben fatto.sono soddisfatto dell'acquisto e mi viene voglia di comprare altre cose da questo artigiano.grazie
"
"I really like the ring! The fit is perfect, and the seller sent it very quickly, too.
"
"Boy, this was fast service, as the seller is in Turkey -- the ring came SO FAST.  Amazing!!!  The seller worked with me closely on e-mail about the size and the stones -- a super-nice guy.  Although I had hoped for a yellower green stone, the olive color is lovely and one that I wear a lot.  The purple side is stunning.  I wish I could post a picture -- it won't let me???  The ring is so pretty!
"
"I was so intrigued by the idea of a reversible ring that I had to buy one.   I love it.  It's quite cleverly designed and it is very sparkly- my favorite things sparkle.  We had a bit of a problem with the shipping of the first ring.  Giftforher shipped it very quickly - but somehow it got lost in Logistics Purgatory in Memphis TN.   They promptly shipped me another one  and I am thrilled with it.   Very nice people.
"
"I don‚Äôt know where to begin, because it is that good.  The ring is as gorgeous as your wildest expectations, CeM is an attentive, helpful and honest  vendor, and he deserves every high praise he receives.  I am a customer for life!  E sure to put your phone number and receipt in the package, because customs will think it is much more expensive than it is!  I am extremely pleased. It also comes in this beautiful wooden box - wow!  Above and beyond.
"
"Another beautiful work of art from this shop! Again, I highly recommend purchasing from GiftforherCo! The owner is a pleasure to deal with and the jewelry is gorgeous. The picture does not do it justice. The workmanship is intricate and the gemstones sparkle. The item arrived quickly. I am so pleased!
"
"Love this ring!!!! Its so nice and has survived my many hot showers.
"
"Beautiful ring. Excellent communication from seller. Extremely helpful & easily exchanged for a smaller size as I had measured wrong size. Would definitely recommend & I will be purchasing again in the near future.
"
"I ordered the wrong size at first, but the seller was lovely and exchanged it for a smaller size. Such a helpful seller and a beautiful ring. It was also delivered very quickly.
"
 
"I am absolutely in love with these rings! Shipping is insanely fast coming from so far away and product it stunning! I have nothing negative to say at all about these rings but If you do not like rings that sit high up on your finger be aware that these sit about 1/2 to 3/4 inch above your finger.  Personally i love them, they are eye catching conversation starters! Gorgeous!
"
"Beautiful piece of jewelry. Love it. No longer wear my wedding rings. This is my new All About Me ring.
"
"Shipping to the US was faster than expected (10 days) and the ring is even more beautiful in person.  So happy!  Thank!
"
"Love love love onyx!!!  The reversible feature is very easy to maneuver & inconspicuous when wanting to have either Stone present.  Thank you üôèüèΩ
"
"Turned out perfect.
"
"Hubby bought this for Christmas and it's even more beautiful in person than I'd imagined! (I gave him 3 ring choices so I could still be ""surprised""). So sparkly and beautiful, I just keep staring at it! I get to carry my family birthstones wherever I go now and that's pretty special. Gorgeous- thank you!
"
"I bought this ring as a Christmas present for my Mother. She adored it, but the size was incorrect.  The Jewelry Girls Place allowed me to return the ring, re-sized it & sent it back quickly.  My mom wears the ring daily & is so happy.  I'm impressed with the quality, ease of ordering shipping/reshipping (which can sometimes be a nightmare - not with this company!) & the quality of the ring.  Thank you Jewelry Girls!
"
"OMG thank you so much! Not only is it beautiful, but when I said it was a birthday gift for my daughter, she bumped it up and I had it in 3 days! Will most definitely buy from them again. And they actually respond ASAP to messages, unlike many others I‚Äôve dealt with on Etsy. My daughter will LOVE THIS!!!
"
"Ik ben super blij met deze poncho! Het voldoet precies aan mijn verwachtingen en ik hoefde er niet lang op te wachten. Hij is prachtig! Levendige kleuren! Ik had expres voor Tawantinsuyu als kleur gekozen omdat dat de naam is van de 4 streken van het Inca Rijk. Blij mee!
"
"Samstag erst bestellt, heute schon da. Das ging wirklich sehr schnell!
Die N√§hte dieser h√ºbschen Maske sind sehr gut! Ich freue mich darauf, sie zu tragen!
Vielen Dank! <3
"
"J‚Äôai achet√© l‚Äô√©chiquier p√©ruvien et j‚Äôen suis ravie, il est vraiment magnifique, que ce soit les pi√®ces ou l‚Äô√©chiquier lui m√™me ! L‚Äôenvoie √† √©t√© tr√®s rapide, tr√®s soign√©, bien emball√©. 
Juste un petit b√©mol : le jeu √† une forte odeur de white spirit (s√ªrement les produits pour finition, je l‚Äôai laiss√© a√©rer)... mais cela ne change en rien la qualit√© du jeu ! Merci beaucoup en tout cas, je recommande ce vendeur ! ‚ú®‚ú®
"
"tr√®s joli, tr√®s doux, mais tr√®s tr√®s petit ! je ne rentre pas dedans, ni mon mari (qui n'a pas autant de cheveux que moi !)...je vais le garder pour mes filles ; elles se battent d√©j√† pour l'avoir ; √† noter que sur ma puce de 6 ans, il est √† peine un peu trop grand !
"
"Super happy! Spencer was very responsive, and was willing to customize a wedding band for me to match my engagement ring, I sent the dimensions of my existing ring and Spencer created a stunning band to match, the two are identical, which is saying a lot for its unique size! Then to top it off, the ring arrived early! Overall great experience! Only minor detail is that I had requested the platinum be rhodium plated to match my other ring, and it was not, not a big deal however since it is not industry practice to rhodium plate platinum, and I‚Äôm still happy because I‚Äôm sure the rhodium plating on my other ring will eventually wear off and the two will match. All in all, it‚Äôs perfect, and I love it, and Spencer was great to work with, and I would highly recommend!
"
"Beautiful wedding band shaped perfectly to my cluster with minimal hassle, just provided a photo of the ring I wanted it shaped too. Very excited to wear this once I'm married. Perfect product, Perfect service!
"
"Fits beautifully with my engagement ring. Ordering was simple; I just sent a picture to the shop and it showed up a few weeks later. Very fairly priced, as well, compared to some other places I was looking for the same exact thing. Thanks!
"
"I love it! Bought this for my wedding ring and it fits perfectly around my engagement ring, beautiful üòç
"
"Excellent service and delivery. 
An amazing ring!
 Stones move a bit 
and there is a small crack I did not see in the picture. 
real diamonds!

 Thank you I am very happy üôè
"
"I am absolutely IN LOVE with this gorgeous ring, which is my new wedding bad! I looked for months and months for the right emerald ring that would reflect the uniqueness I desired and fit nicely with my vintage engagement ring. I have never seen anything like this one! The seller was so polite, helpful, and communicative about my purchase, every step of the way keeping me informed about where the ring was and when it would get to me. The shop has so many interesting, one of a kind pieces - I will absolutely order through them again!
"
"absolutely delighted with my purchase. the ring is beautiful even nicer than the photos. delivery was really quick  great communication from seller. would highly recommend to everyone. thank you very much.
"
"Wonderful service, fast and clear responses! Thank you for a very special experience, I can‚Äôt wait to surprise my mum with this exquisite ring!
"
"Love this Sapphire and crystal ring. The mounting is beautiful. The fit is perfect. This ring goes with everything.
"
"A very nice one 
Beautiful design

The after sales service is as good as the service provided from the first contact - thank you

I can 100% recoment this shop

"
"I asked for ruby because all three of my boys are July and I‚Äôve had trouble finding a mothers ring with three very different rings.  This is perfect and arrived the day before Mother‚Äôs Day.  Each ring represents the personality of each kid.  I am so grateful and happy. Thank you so much.
"
"The silver work is beautiful (smooth, no firescale!), the cabochon is balanced, perfectly clear and feels extremely secure in the bezel. Thank you for this mesmerizing dewdrop; I‚Äôll wear this often.
"
"I am so happy with my new ring! I bought a ring previously online and it seemed much smaller than the picture. This one was even more beautiful than the picture. I also appreciated the numerous updates about the progress of making my ring and shipping my ring. I knew where it was every step of the way. I highly recommend this jeweler!
"
"This exquisite ring is a milestone birthday gift from my children, that will hopefully become an heirloom for my family, and Robert took the time to perfectly make it just the way I envisioned it to be, featuring the birthstones of my husband and kids. The picture just can't adequately convey how very beautiful this ring really is. Everything about it is very fine and dainty and it is so wonderfully crafted and I have received so many compliments on how lovely it is. Robert was also kind enough to allow me to pester him with questions and each one was answered promptly and patiently, even on the weekend ! It truly has been an easy and enjoyable experience to create the perfect ring, thank you so much for everything Robert, I will wear it with pride every single day.
"
"I had been dreaming of an emerald ring for years. I wanted a ring that reflected the things I find most visually compelling: royal and aristocratic portraiture, period dramas, palaces, castles, and stately homes. There are some fabulous rings out there, but they do not necessarily reflect the sense of historicized grandeur I craved.
I stumbled on Robert's shop quite by chance and fell in love with this ring.
It is now in my possession, and it is everything I dreamed of and more.
Throughout the process, Robert has been most kind and attentive. I will definitely be buying more treasures from his jewellery shop.
"
"The custom ring I ordered absolutely exceeded my expectations! The attention to detail, craftsmanship and ease of communication throughout the process was excellent. I cannot recommend this store enough. Thank you for a beautiful ring that I will treasure forever. Pictures do not do this ring justice. Thank you!
"
"What a spectacular ring!!! It fits my finger perfectly and that does not happen usually. I am in awe of your workmanship in creating this beauty!! Thank you.
"
"Gorgeous stones and layout!  Thank you
"
"gorgeous just as i knew it would be
"
 
"I've never made such a large purchase via the internet, so when my rings didn't arrive on the estimated delivery date with 2-day shipping, and in fact seemed to have dropped off the grid entirely according to USPS's website, I was a little bit terrified! But Natalia is amazing at communication and helped me check in with USPS as well as updated me on what our options would be if they didn't show up-- and my rings did arrive (just two days later than USPS originally guesstimated-- not WingedLion's fault at all) and are wonderful! I could not be happier with my purchase. Perhaps even better, less than three weeks passed between me ordering and receiving two rings! That's amazing. Thank you. (:
"
"Absolutely love it! It just arrived today, and it's definitely my favorite. I thought it would be much heavier, but it's actually fairly light. Thank you for the good service, I will definitely look at your jewelry first next time I'm buying.
"
"This ring is beautiful and Natalia was so gracious in working out a sizing problem with my original order.  I love your work and will definitely shop with you again.
"
"Gorgeous to the smallest detail! Goes perfectly with the matching earrings. This is a real work of art. Thank you!!!
"
"I do love this ring. Accurately, it's quite tiny, more so than anticipated, but it's eye catching despite this and the sparkle is subtle and lovely even indoor without direct lighting. This may be a gateway piece to other such delicate adornments for me. 
Purchase was a bit slow to arrive, as can be the case when traveling great distances (international shipping). That said, this was not entirely due to shipping, as my updates did make aware the processing of the order, which accounted for a significant amount of time. That said, I am pleased with both purchases made here, and would advise patience in any setting regarding such circumstances. :)
"
"I loved this ring! It is so simple yet stunning. Its great to use with stacking rings. Shipping was faster than I thought for being international.
"
"Der Ring ist wundersch√∂n und toll gemacht! Ich hoffe ich kann mich noch lange an ihm erfreuen!
The ring is beautiful and great! I hope I can enjoy him for a long time!
"
"Absolutely gorgeous - I love how dainty and perfect it is. Thank you!!
"
"Love this ring.  Great and easy transaction  Two thumbs up!
"
"Beautiful jewelry, purchased as a gift.  Lovely.
"
 
"I received my ring in the mail today and was so excited to see the finished product. When I opened the box, I fell in love. The ring is even more beautiful in person. I will definitely buy from this shop again.
"
"Gorgeous gorgeous ring! I‚Äôd been looking for one like this for ages and finally decided to go for something super high quality, and I don‚Äôt regret it for a second! I‚Äôve worn this almost every day since I got it, and I love seeing all the stones and colors in the light. Great customer service!!!
"
"My experience with this store was perfect. 

The seller is super friendly and easy to deal with, and I appreciated how quickly my messages were addressed. The ring is neither heavy, not too thick which is exactly what I was looking for. It is exactly as described on the website. I was looking for a stacking ring, so I do recommend getting this piece if that is what you are looking for. Nevertheless, it does look wonderful on its own also. 

The shipping of the item was super fast; However, it did seem to be affected given the outgoing pandemic, but the seller was quick to check up on me to explain the situation. 

Will most likely purchase from their store again.
"
"I have purchased from Zoe Lev several times and everything has been wonderful quality and I get many compliments.
"
"It's really beautiful but it's not quite the same as the first image shown. There are fewer colors and the order of the stones is not random like in the photo but a repeating pattern. It doesn't detract from the ring's beauty in any way. It's nice and slim and sits well with my other stacking rings.
"
"It fits perfectly and looks exactly like the picture. The material looks really good and the beads are smooth.
"
"Sehr sch√∂ne Ringe..passen super..Gute Qualit√§t..5Sterne!!!
"
 
"Sehr gute Qualit√§t und sehr schneller Versand. Eine individuelle L√§nge war kein Problem.
"
"So absolutely in love with my ring! It came in a timely fashion, and I was blown away by how perfect it was. I lost my boy the beginning of April, I wanted something I could use to always have a part of him with me. This ring has honestly been such a nice reminder of all the amazing times I had with my dog. Totally recommend getting this ring to remember your pet or even just because. ‚ù§Ô∏è
"
"My wife loved this necklace! It seems to be really great quality. The packaging was great too. Shipping was a little slow as it took about a month to arrive but worth the wait. It can be a little tricky to view the photo through the phone but once we figured it out it was really neat!

We lost our beautiful girl Luna this past April. I thought this would be a great way we could carry her with us on all of our adventures.
"
"I loved itttt!!!!!
"
"Oh my goodness! I wish I could give this review more than 5 stars!!!!! This turned out amazing! I bought this for a friend who recently lost her dog. It‚Äôs absolutely perfect. Thank you so much!!!!!!!!!!
"
"Amazing and professionally made ring. Made and delivered in 10 days. That is not just impressive but unheard of these days.
Thank you, Sinan!!!
"
"Lovely workmanship! I‚Äôm so happy with the ring. Shipping was quick and arrived in time for hubby‚Äôs birthday.  It‚Äôs a great size too!
"
"the perfect ring beautifully made!!!!
"
"Absolutely everything that I thought and wanted to be. The detail is unbelievable. 
Yours Truly.... Very Happy!!!
"
 
"The seller was super responsive to all my questions and the ring is such good quality! It has a nice weight to it and is very comfortable. The design is amazing! Overall this is exactly what I wanted!
"
"So cute. Just what I have been looking for. I‚Äôm obsessive. The seller told me I wouldn‚Äôt be disappointed and I sure am not
"
"This ring is perfect. I bought this as a graduation gift and it‚Äôs exactly what I expected. I sent the seller a picture of the logo I wanted for the ring, she responded quickly, and before I knew it, my order had shipped! I was very pleased when it arrived. Can‚Äôt wait to gift it to my sister!
"
"its soooo pretty and true to size... I got a size 9 1/2 because i have long fingers and it fits my middle finger, my index finger and even my thumb:)
"
"For reference I‚Äôm a size 6!
"
"Super cute and dainty, exactly what I wanted. I‚Äôve been wearing it everyday since I got it and it feels high quality. I got a size 7 in case anyone was curious.
"
"Literally the cutest ring I have. Got here faster than I was expecting and came in this adorable little ring box ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è Love love love it
"
"This is a very beautiful ring! üíï‚ù§Ô∏èüíï I wished I would had ordered this in a size 7 because the size 8 is to big for my pinky. I might just put it on a gold filled necklace so that I want loose it by it sliding off my finger but this ring is absolutely gorgeous!

Thank you üòä I am very happy with my purchase I will order Again from this seller and recommend to this seller

Awesome work guys ‚ù§Ô∏è
"
"Seriously the best purchase ever!! Came within two days of ordering it and looks so real! I‚Äôm in love with my new ring
"
"Perfection! This ring is everything I thought and wanted it to be! Best deal in Etsy! LOVE. Love. Love.
"
"My sister loved it so much so much. It is well done. I appreciate that it isnone solid piece and not hollowed or concave inside of the ring, underneath the initials. It truly is beautiful. It feels androgynous but with a hint of femininity. I am kinda envious that I didn't get one myself. But that might change soon. Thank you much.
"
"Ich bin sehr zufrieden mit dem Ring ,er passt und sieht einfach gut aus
"
"Love this ring. Buyer was easy to work with and has great customer service.
"
"Sadly, on reading the finer print, I realize that this is not gold, but gold-plated brass. In one description it says ""material-gold"" and in another it says ""gold plated-brass""
The product is already tarnishing and I've only had for a few weeks.
"
"This is a beautiful ring. It is EXACTLY what I was hoping for. The letter 'M' 
in old English font is the perfect look and because it signifies my daughter's name, it means so much more to me. Thank you Alon for this amazing ring and for quickly replying to my questions.  I highly recommend this shop! .... and it even arrived way earlier than expected.
"
"I have been eyeing this ring for I don‚Äôt even remember how long, LOL! I don‚Äôt know why I waited so long because not only is it lightweight and gorgeous, but I can actually write with it on. I am so in love!
"
"A perfectly- and I mean perfectly- crafted dandelion ring- the detail is superb, I adore it! Fast shipping and a lovely note from the owner makes this a perfect transaction- I am very thrilled with this shop and this purchase- I am wearing this gorgeous ring as I am typing this review- extremely happy!! Thank you!!
"
"This ring is even more gorgeous than what I saw in the pictures! It is super light, and although big, is not cumbersome on my finger. I will definitely come back to this shop!!!
"
"Gorgeous. Just stunning. I order three items from her and they all exceeded my expectations. The packaging was beautiful. I am absolutely ordering so much more from her. Thank you Natali.
"
"beautiful ring, very artistic.
"
"Thank you to TomikArt for their beautiful donations.  I am very lucky to have support from such a talented lady. The items are stunning, I can't believe they are hand made. They were also sent beautifully presented.
"
"Oh my gosh... this is the most BEAUTIFUL bracelet I have ever owned! It is perfect... the colors are my colors and the craftsmanship is amazing. I cannot wait to show it off. I will definitely be back for more. I HIGHLY recommend this Seller as she was great to deal with when I requested to have matching earrings made to go with the bracelet. Great service. Great quality!!!!
"
"What talent!!  These are amazing and getting compliments everywhere I go!!
"
"I NEVER write reviews. But Sila's excellent craftsmanship deserves one. The ring is absolutely gorgeous and the sizing is right on point! I have ""fleshy"" a.k.a chubby fingers and a size 9 fit me like a glove. The ring is an OPEN back, a pretty shiny gold, and the engraving is deep. I will definitely be ordering from Sila's shop again! As for shipping, I order on Nov 4th and it got to me by Nov. 14th. 10 DAYS from Turkey! So impressive!
"
"I Love it!! i ordered a size 6 in sterling silver, which is the normal size i wear but it was a taaaaad bit big for my ring finger; so i had to put it on the first finger. I definitely am ordering one more for my other hand but this time in a size 5. The ring structure is perfect and so is the engraving. She did a perfect job! Delivery took a nice minute, but that is because I chose standard shipping instead of expediting. Overall, I will DEFINITELY order from her again.
"
"I loved the ring. However, I ordered Gold Filled and it faded to silver way quicker than I thought. I would say in about 1 week. I do wear it every day but I took it off when washing hands or showering. And it took close to 4 weeks to get to the US (just as an FYI)
But the ring itself is beautiful and the engraving looks great. So thanks !
"
"No photo yet but super pleased a real beauty !!!
"
"I can not take it off.  Lovely.
"
"todo excelente, el producto y el env√≠o. Absolutamente recomendable
"
"The ring arrived on time and in beautiful condition! I‚Äôm in love! I bought this ring as a temporary replacement for my wedding band/engagement ring and I‚Äôm so pleased! So pleased! 

I ordered a size slightly larger than the finger I had it slotted for. Just in case it 1) ran small or 2) ran big, so it would fit another finger, and it exceeded my expectations! (I wear a typical 1/2 size on most of my fingers so it‚Äôs a personal struggle of mine.) 

This ring is more gorgeous in person than in the pictures and worth it!
"
"This was absolutely what I was looking for. I was looking for a swoosh ring and this one was beautiful.
"
"This is a picture of 3 of the rings I purchased from Venexia. They are absolutely stunning and look like they were made for royalty! Beautiful craftsmanship with an antique feel to them. I get so many complements on them. I wear them every single day!!
"
"Such a beautiful stacking ring and exactly as pictured. My husband bought it for me to go with my engagement diamond, as my wedding band can sometimes feel a bit flashy to wear with the diamond day-to-day. We got this for me to wear on the other days and it compliments it perfectly! Thank you so much! ‚ú®
"
"I absolutely love Dany‚Äôs work (shop owner/artist). I have purchased most of my gold jewelry from her. Her work is breathtaking!! I usually pair multiple rings together on one finger. This pic has 3 of her pieces in it. The top and bottom rings are specific to this retail posting. The middle, thicker ring, was also made by her. I highly recommend Venexia‚Äôs artwork/jewelry‚Äîyou will always receive QUALITY!
"
"Such a  gorgeous, very beautiful ring! It's prettier than I thought:) The ring is well made and unique, perfect work. I'm happy!! 
Dany (the owner/artist) was very responsive and helped a lot with a difficult delivery situation. Thank you so very much :)
"
"Absolutely impressive this ring. The design it's exactly the same from the advertise. It is a little big for my fingers, but the good thing, is it is adjustable. To be sincere, the ring¬¥s arriving to my country took one more month from the expected. A part from it everything it¬¥s OK with the ring. It¬¥s the best complement for my other Norse ring. Thank you!
"
"The ring looks exactly like the pictures  and arrived a lot earlier than expected (Germany) 

The build quality is very good, and the little bag is cute, even though you can't really close it (you would need to tie the bands). Overall I would definitely buy from them again!
"
"Absolutely magnificent ring. The pictures dont do it justice, extremely happy with it. This design would be epic in gold! (but expensive).
"
"Sono molto soddisfatta dell'acquisto, anche se ha un prezzo un po' alto, ne vale veramente la pena. L'anello √® curato nei minimi dettagli,  ha una buona vestibilit√†, non √® troppo grosso come mi aspettavo e consiglio l'acquisto!
"
"Thank you so much. The ring is perfect!

√áok te≈üekk√ºr ederim y√ºz√ºk m√ºkemmel
"
"My sister loves it thank you so much!!
"
 
 
"I love my ring! It is perfect, just like the photo. The engraving is gorgeous and it is a perfect every day right. Not too big, not too small. The customer service I received was excellent as well! Thank you!!
"
"I love this ring.  I was surprised at how fast I received it.
Any questions I had were answered promptly.  I',m 
looking forward to my next purchase.  I really like 
some of the unique things at Etsy.
"
"Love my ring so much! I ordered a size 5 for my ring finger and it fits perfect!
"
"This is my second order from this shop and I am so very happy with how all of my orders have turned out. Shipping is really quick, which is great for people like me who need instant gratification! The shop owner is super responsive to messages and is highly focused on amazing customer service. This is my new go-to shop for beautiful, personalized gifts!
"
"I really like the look of this ring and it fits perfectly with no adjustment! I would give it 5 stars if the band itself wasn't made of copper which turns my finger green after only a couple hours of wear. Still a great piece of jewelry though!
"
"It‚Äôs a cool ring, simple and and complicated at the same time.  I attached two stones on the face, to personalize it.  It shipped fairly quick, considering it‚Äôs from across the pond.  The shop owner is friendly. And the whole experience was good.
"
"Merci tr√®s joli super contente de mon achat et communication tr√®s bien avec le vendeur r√©ponse rapide üëçüëçüëçüëç
"
"Beautiful ring, true to pictures. 
Ewa was also especially helpful because the first time around the post company lost the ring, she re-sent it free of charge. Definitely recommend buying from her shop! :)
"
"This ring is absolutely beautiful! The band is smooth and isn‚Äôt too wide, it‚Äôs just right. I couldn‚Äôt be happier! Merry Christmas to me. :)
"
"Love this ring !! I was nervous about the etching, but it is beautiful. The letters are crisp, centered, and proportioned nicely. I got a size 7. I am very satisfied with this purchase!
"
"Love love love this! I am between a 3 and 4 ring size and got a 4 and it fits very well, not too tight! Love the engraving too, very professional! And speedy delivery to the UK üëèüèº
"
"What a beautiful ring.  I love this.  It is my second ring as the first one got lost.  I ALWAYS get so many compliments on this timeless piece of jewelry.  Love the ring. Great and fast service.
"
"Lakis from NarcissusFineJewelery was such a delight to work with. Very responsive, friendly and helpful. He accommodated all my requests and questions. The ring is gorgeous and great quality. Will definitely buy more from this store.
"
"Some of the best customer service I have experienced on Etsy! The ring is beautiful and arrived very quickly. It is excellent quality.
"
"Very beautiful and dainty necklace! Exactly what I wanted. I‚Äôm already getting compliments on it. I‚Äôm shocked by how fast it got here. All the way from Athens to California in about a week. I will definitely order from this shop again. The picture doesn‚Äôt do it justice!
"
"My daughter loves her Signet ring Latkis made for her. She said it exceeded her expectations and she loves it! Thank you so much. Very excellent service and quality.
"
"I love my ring. It is exactly as shown in the pictures and very beautiful. I usually do not wear any jewelry but this ring is so plain and light that I don't feel like I'm wearing a ring. 
Many thanks to GlorriaSense who also beautifully engraved the name of my daughter above the flower.
"
"Let me tell you! I absolutely adore this ring that I actually just bought a second one with my birth flower. Highly recommended
"
"It‚Äôs so cute and exactly what I asked for!! Highly recommend
"
"Gorgeous ring and a fast delivery, make me want to purchase other jewellery soon!!
"
"Beautiful ring, sellers were great to work w/ - re adjustment in size or type of stone. And it arrived very fast.
"
"Great quality ring & excellent seller communication. Would definately reccomend.
"
"From the moment I first saw this ring,  my experience has been 10 out of 10. Danelian Jewelry answered every single question I had (within a very short time!) and helped me all the way through to receiving my ring (very promptly!). The ring is gorgeous, heavy (in a good way), well-made, but the main reason for my review is the absolutely amazing customer service experienced with the seller. If I could give 6 stars I would! Thank you so much for everything, I can't wait to give this ring to my husband for our wedding anniversary. I will definitely be purchasing from this shop again! Thank you thank you thank you!!
"
"This jeweler crafts his jewelry very well. The customer service despite the time zone difference is responsive and polite. I love my ruby ring and will be back for another piece of jewelry in the future. Thank you so much!

Btw: I tested the gold out because I was skeptical and it‚Äôs pure. No worries here.
"
"I LOVE LOVE LOVE MY RING!!!! I truly cannot express enough how amazing this shop is and the owner, Hann! I graduated this May and wanted a really pretty class ring. I came across this shop and thought I‚Äôd give it a try. Within an hour of ordering, Hann contacted me and started helping me design my ring. I didn‚Äôt have a quality picture to give her but she was able to make it work and sent me a 3D picture of the ring the same day I ordered it. She is so sweet and will do absolutely anything that she can to make sure you love your jewelry! Not only that but shipping was incredibly fast. IT ONLY TOOK 2 DAYS! She is from Turkey and I live in the US and it only took 2 days to ship. I honestly couldn‚Äôt believe how fast it was. PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE order from here, you will not regret it!! üíõüíõüíõ
"
"Oh my gosh I cannot say enough great things about this shop! The owner is fantastic! She contacted me a couple hours after I placed my order and sent me 3-D photos of what my ring would look like and asked if I would like to make any changes (I didn‚Äôt need to though because it was perfect!). My ring arrived 6 days after placing my order and just in time for graduation! The quality of the ring is amazing and I couldn‚Äôt be happier!
"
"I purchased this ring for my daughters high school graduation. It was a rather last minute thought and I was worried I wouldn‚Äôt get it on time due to International Shipping. Not only was the artist so helpful, communicative and fast, the ring arrived today 3 days ahead of schedule (total order turn around time less than 2 weeks door to door) - the ring arrived and it is STUNNING. Took my breath away. The fact that it was handcrafted and her school logo is beautifully imprinted around gemstones... eloquent and bold. Fitting for a student who worked so hard during a global pandemic and overcame so much to finish strong. And she wasn‚Äôt able to purchase a class ring from the school, so this is even beyond special. Highly recommended for all the proud graduates and alumni in your life! You will not be disappointed!!!
"
"I absolutely love my ring! Hann was so attentive and made sure I loved everything about my ring before making it. She sent me a 3D image of it which was so helpful. Shipping was very quick and did not cost extra. The whole process took 2 weeks tops, my sister has ordered from other Etsy shops and her ring took months! 10/10 (:
"
"So cute! Love it so much ‚ô•Ô∏è
"
"A little fatter than I thought it was going to be but still very cute!
"
 
"I love this ring! It‚Äôs so cute, it‚Äôs thick and feels like a great quality of silver was used. I can‚Äôt wait to wear this all the time!
"
"Good quality, Loving my ring. I just hope won‚Äôt change the color. But it‚Äôs perfect!! I don‚Äôt know why looks so weird on the picture, I don‚Äôt know if it is just my app or what, but it‚Äôs definitely better in person.
"
"I love this ring, it's even better in person than it looks on the website.  It did take a long time to get (2 1/2 months)  but so happy it finally came.
"
"It is sooo beautiful and I was struggling to find someone who made rings small enough for me so I was thrilled with my ring! It also came super fast it was supposed to arrive around feb 28 but I got it sometime before feb 14th. I would be aware that the gold scratches SUPER easily mine is marked up pretty bad already but I do not mind at all as it is really beautiful and doesn‚Äôt take away from it for me and it does not tarnish as that was my main goal. I‚Äôve worn this ring everyday for a couple weeks and it is still as gold as when I first pulled it out of the box.
"
"OBSESSED with my new ring! Exactly as pictured and so so cute! Thank you!
"
"Absolutely obsessed with this ring it‚Äôs exactly  what I was looking for.
So dainty and shiny! 
It sits low profile so doesn‚Äôt catch on anything and actually comes in sizes small enough for my pinky finger! 
Arrived so quickly even though it came from the UK (I‚Äôm in Australia) 
The quality is exceptional and I‚Äôve received so many compliments! Such an amazing ring will definitely be buying more from this shop, would recommend to anyone! :)
"
"I love this ring, it is so shiny and delicate. I got it for my pinky and got a size 2. It's a little big on me, but that's my fault cuz I didn't fully know the size I needed. Stephen responded quickly when I had inquired about the delivery. It took a little long but that's because it was international delivery plus everything going on with Covid. Overall, I'm super happy with my purchase!
"
"I love this ring, it‚Äôs beautiful and very dainty and feminine. My only gripe is that it is so thin on the band I‚Äôm scared it‚Äôs going to bend if I hit it off something, so I‚Äôll just be very careful. Otherwise, beautiful ring and seller is very friendly. Thank you so much!
"
"Great delivery- I ordered this ring on a Sunday evening and it arrived Tuesday!! 

It‚Äôs absolutely stunning, so dainty and  exactly what I‚Äôve been looking for. It‚Äôs also amazing that they provides such variety of sizes- I have tiny pinky fingers so it‚Äôs usually impossible to get rings to fit.! 
It‚Äôs extremely comfortable too. 

Beautiful piece, great price, free delivery- I couldn‚Äôt recommend Stephen knapper more! Thank you!
"
"I am so happy with my beautiful ring with engraving!! I think of my little daughter even more when I look at it/wear it. Thank you, I'll be back again!!
"
"I LOVE this ring!! This was made so well. It has a good weight to it too so you get your worth for sure. Young was so nice to work with. All questions and answers were addressed in a timely matter. I will definitely repurchase again!!! Thank you Young for my beautiful ring! It's just what I was looking for!
"
"The ring is beautiful.  I had been searching for an everyday signet ring and this fits the bill perfectly.  Added bonus--a courteous and responsive seller--will be back!
"
"I love this ring -- it arrived quickly and I've been wearing it constantly!  I do, however, wish that the tapered bottom of the ring shank wasn't so thin. While keeping gold usage down to price this beautiful ring reasonably is important, I worry about misshaping it from normal wear.
"
"This ring is amazing! Sizing is spot on. The ring is just as advertised, and the engraving is crisp and defined. Seller was wonderful to work with, especially when I needed to make a last minute change on my shipping address. The ring was shipped promptly and arrived quickly from Israel. It came neatly packaged in a cute gift box. I've had my eye on this ring for a while and I am so happy to call it mine. Thank you! #TCB
"
"Beautiful!! Awesome!! Made very well & size exact!! Thank You!!
"
"It takes a while to get here from Israel but it is an excellent ring
"
"Nice ring. Clean, polished, well made. Looks a little small, probably order a size bigger than you need. Came in a cute silver gift box & bag, ready to wrap for Christmas!  He is gonna LOVE this.
"
"I love love love this ring. I ordered the gold. However, I received the silver. I love it and will keep it. I‚Äôm going to order the gold again. 

Thank you much,
"
"i ordered and really love  for me I am having to take to jeweler to size up one size  my ring size is an 8 but this ring did not fit I like it well enough to pay for the sizing
I know I will really enjoy  have already worn and had compliments

thanks
"
"Beautiful, quality ring. Wrapped beautifully and with care. Amazing shop
"
"Purchased this ring as a gift for myself and I absolutely love it!!  I have gotten many compliments along with asking where I got it. Very well made and I love the unique style.
"
"I absolutely LOVE my ring.  It‚Äôs beautiful.  I find it amazing how something as simple as this can be so beautiful but it really is.  I just got it today and have worn it for only a few hours so I can‚Äôt speak if it‚Äôs quality.  With that being said it does seem to be very good quality though, I will definitely buy from them again.  Thank you
"
"Really like the ring. Shiny, looks well made. I was expecting the metal to be thick but its thinner in real life than the picture. Its described to be gold filled, so it shouldn't tarnish, but I just got it so I can't comment on how it's shine will last. I love the cute packaging that came with it. Only 4 stars because it took 2 1/2 weeks before I received the package.
"
"I luv my new pinky ring
"
"Yes it's just gorgeous love it.
"
"Absolutely love this ring! what a beautiful piece. thank you!
"
"Absolutely love my custom made signet ring. I asked Ayala to re-create a ring with sentimental value that I had lost, and she did so well! The quality is beautiful and the communication with Ayala was easy as well. Would highly recommend!
"
"The ring is PERFECT! I was in a rush for my wedding and Ayala worked with me to get it here on time. I‚Äôm VERY pleased with the ring. Amazing costumer service. Very responsive. Thank you Ayala.
"
"Ayala is so lovely and very helpful! Ring is beautiful too!!
"
"These rings are perfect for building my statement but an everyday wearable collection. Wearing the Gold Face Ring (index finger) and the Gold Flower Spinner Ring (ring finger). Both gorgeous and unique. Quality craftsmanship as well. I can't believe how quickly my package arrived. So happy with this first order, and I already have my eye on some others, so I will undoubtedly buy from this shop again and highly recommend it!
"
"Such a beautiful ring! I get so many compliments when I wear it. I didn't realize that this is my second purchase from this artist so I guess I really like his work :-) Thank you!
"
"I love this ring! It is the most unique and well crafted ring I  own. It is even better in person. Thank you so much for crafting this amazing ring.  Crazy fast delivery!  Thank you again.
"
"Absolutely stunning ring.   Better in person picture doesn‚Äôt do it justice
"
"Its absolutely gorgeous! I didn‚Äôt think I would love it as much as I do. It fits comfortably and shines real nicely.
"
"The ring is amazing (left one). The finish is matte (satine) and the details look beautiful.
"
"Ordered this for my twenty year-old daughter who just loved it. She is an art student with a penchant for ancient Greece. The design is lovely and seems to be well-made. We did follow the advice from the seller to paint the inside of the ring with clear nail polish.
"
"Gorgeous handmade ring! It‚Äôs very unique and of great quality.
"
"The pictures are deceiving. Although they look good the real thing is far different. It's like trying to take a picture of the moon on your phone, it can't quite capture the wonder of it. The darkness and depth in real life makes this absolutely stunning.  There are subtle highlights of polished silver and the level of detail is extraordinary. For the shipping the tracking didn't quite work but I wasn't worried this shop has so much positive feed back it's easy to trust it. It went from the Ukraine to the United States then to Bahrain where I am stationed in under a month which is worth 5 stars as it is but the ring surpasses all expectations I almost feel guilty wearing it because it should be mounted and displayed
"
"I couldn't love this ring more than I do.  The fit is fantastic, the design is beautiful, and the detail superb.  If you're thinking about buying this piece just do it, you won't regret a thing when it quickly arrives.   Vladimir is an amazing seller who has great communication and wants you to love any piece you buy.   I couldn't recommend more highly.
"
"This ring looks even better than I thought it would. It's manly & it looks awesome next to my Raven ring. All Hail Odin!
"
"Finally I got this beautiful ring even tough the shipping did take a while to reach me. The ring is a real high quality piece with very tiny details you could find on this small ring. The designer must have spent much time working on it. I'll be back in the future.
"
"I love this ring. I ordered the same ring a couple years ago (?) and thought I had lost it. So I ordered another one. (If it was shipped from Paris, it arrived amazingly fast.) Then I found the original. Now I have two. Obviously, I love this ring!
"
"The ring is exactly like the picture and fits perfect! I bought it as a gift and initially was worried about shipping since I live in Canada and it was coming from France and with COVID but it arrived a week and a half after I placed the order. I was amazed at how quickly it arrived.I am very happy with the prompt and courteous service and was assured that I would get it on time. It came in a cute box with a nice card and wrapping paper. 

Will buy from them again!
"
"Turned out even better than I had hoped! Really beautiful ring, strong sturdy metal. Also, because it‚Äôs a gift, the seller included the tiniest little gift bag & tissue paper..but it‚Äôs perfect! Tiny in a super cute, accurate amount kind of way! Thanks so much, sry the review took long, took a while to arrive (covid). Thanks again! Love it!
"
"I love this ring.  I imagined it being heavy in weight.  But when I received it - it was light - elegant - hip! 
Seller responded quickly and gave an exceptional experience.  I will definitely buy more from her.
"
"This came out so amazing and inexpensive!!! I love it! I also added a ‚Äú2021‚Äù on the inside of the ring. I was debating on my ring size because I‚Äôm a 6 but sometimes a 6 fits a little snug so I got a 6 1/4. It fits on both my ring fingers and on my left middle finger!
"
"Due to university class rings being extremely expensive, I decided to go a different route and am so glad I did! I love absolutely everything about the ring! I am normally a size 6 on my ring finger, but decided to go a bit bigger (6 1/4) in case I wanted to move it around to other fingers. While it tends to sit tight on my middle fingers (as it probably should), it sits perfect on my index and ring fingers. My only extra recommendation is to go a bit bigger on the sizing to allow extra wiggle room. Other than that, the ring is BEYOND great! Thank you so much!
"
"Seller was great. Shipping was a little slow but that was just the state of transport right now. The seller was super responsive and helpful. I put a little ink on the engraving to make it clearer, even though I knew it would darken over time.  I can't quit looking at my ring - it's perfect! I could not be happier with it!
"
"absolutely love it! It took about a week to get here which is faster than I was expecting. Great quality and very minimalistic compared to other class ring designs and a fraction of the price. Get this ring!
"
"I am super happy with my ring, it‚Äôs everything I could dream of! I have wanted a solid Gold signet ring that‚Äôs this dainty for so long. 

The lettering is perfect and I love the italic writing, the band is lovely and thin at the back so it doesn‚Äôt feel uncomfortable. 
The ring is super light weight so it‚Äôs really easy to wear and I have been wearing it daily and is so nice on. 

The delivery time was good as I‚Äôm in the UK and it came from Greece. The whole thing took 3 weeks from start to delivery with is great as it‚Äôs custom made for you personally. 

I will be ordering again!
"
"I love the signet ring! It is so dainty & beautiful - it exceeded my expectations! Definitely will be ordering again from Anna. My ring size is 2.75... I guess size 2.5 would have even fit better, but I assume that my fingers are currently thinner than usual considering the cold weather right now :)
"
"I am absolutely in love with my signet ring! The quality is excellent, and I now wear my new ring everyday. It is a timeless piece that will last me forever.
"
"Great rings! I had my signet ring customized with a photo I‚Äôd sent Anna. She answered all of questions .The detail of the engraving was extremely good, exceeded my expectations. My pinky was a sz 2.5.
"
"Very high quality ring, looks even better than the pictures suggest. Very very happy customer, very fast delivery and very lovely staff, 10/10
"
"Gorgeous looking ring, and nice quality. Good weight to it. Very happy :)
"
"Amazing, stunning ring. So detailed and my boyfriend absolutely loved it. Thank you for the note too, we framed it! <3
100% recommended
"
"Great ring my son loved it
"
"My class ring came and it is gorgeous. Absolutely everything I wanted and 1/4 of the price my school was charging. I got the small size in gold and I love it. The ring ended up taking nearly 2 months to arrive and the shop although quick to respond did make me nervous- glad to have ordered through Etsy in case anything happened. Order early!
"
"+Working with them was wonderful and communication was super easy. They are very helpful and extremely knowledgeable.
-The ring design is slightly different from the image that I sent them; the biggest difference is the font. However, I approved the sample they sent so this is on me. 
-The ring itself isn't great quality. It feels cheap, and the gold foil already has a very small scratch on the inside after one week's wear. I got my ring for 50% off and feel like I overpaid a *little* - I would not be happy if I paid full price.
+That being said, I'm obsessed with my ring. It's light and comfortable and pretty and I've been wanting a college ring for 11 years so I'm glad to finally have one, and I'd rather have an affordable option and give my $ to a small business than one of the two big class ring corporations in the USA.
"
"The ring turned out exactly how I imagined, and I love it!! Everyone I talked to was super helpful and responsive.
"
"I love the ring and and everyone was very sweet, even when I requested a change to my design! It did fit a little smaller than I was expecting but it fits my ring finger comfortably!
"
"Great product. I asked if they could custom engrave a design of my choice and they did. Very happy with the overall experience communicating with the seller and the speed of the production/deliver only took a few days. Would definitely recommend.
"
"Great quality! Loved it
"
 
 
"Was amazing my son loved it the product is amazing and is everything I wanted and more 
Thank you
"
"It is a most attractive men's ring, quite exactly as described. And what a fast overseas shipping Thank you so much.  I'm sure my husband will love it & wear it with pride for many years to come.

"
"I have waited so long to order a pinky ring.  Was it going to be too large , too gaudy?  I came across Limajewelry and decided to order this very simple signet.  I absolutely LOVE it.  It‚Äôs the perfect starter pinky ring.
"

"–ü—Ä–µ–∫—Ä–∞—Å–Ω–æ! –ë–æ–ª—å—à–æ–µ —Å–ø–∞—Å–∏–±–æ! Beautiful ring, exactly what  I wanted.
"
"Just got my ring, arrived a day early according to etsy. The details are amazing and the fit is perfect. I am very happy with my purchase. It does leave a green ring on your finger but I hear clear nail polish is a temporary fix for that.
"
"The shipping time was not unexpected.  However, the ring is so beautiful, I can only say great things.  No picture can do it justice; it looks far better in person.  Highly detailed carving.  The bronze looks like old gold.  I wish the company went beyond the Celtic and Viking.  Russia has great designs too.  Very happy with my purchase.
"
"Thank you so much. I really had the best customer experience and the ring is just lovely. It fits perfectly and looks just as I hoped it would. Would give 10 stars if I could :)
"

"
"The ring is gorgeous, the presentation is lovely and I am completely overwhelmed with joy. Thank you so much gentleman you've easily made my day and quite possibly my year! My grandfather and family with love it. Irish pride!!
"
"Just got my ring yesterday and I couldn't be happier with it. The detail is fantastic, the fit is comfortable, and the accompanying crest on parchment will make a nice addition to my study. If you're looking for a well made, decently priced family crest ring, look no farther than Shield and Crest. Jack is among the nicest people I have interacted with on Etsy and he's quick to answer any questions.
"
"The Family Crest Ring I received is extremely well made, accurate and better than I thought it would be. I bought this ring for my husband's 40th birthday and it was made based on an old family crest photo which I sent to Jack. Jack managed to recreate it as a ring and it is truly a piece of art. It was even shipped (in good condition), all the way to Australia. I am so glad I found Jack's work and am pleased with his customer service and products. Thanks again Jack!
"
"It is a beautiful piece and was delivered quickly.  I am very happy with it!  I will use this vendor again.
"
"I love it! Does run a size smaller on me. Still fits tho. Worth the wait!
"
"I am BLOWN away. Worth the wait and every penny spent. It is AMAZING. Thank you sooooo much.
"
"My boyfriend love it showing it off at my birthday party! Lol
"
"I am absolutely delighted with my ring, I love it! Nelly was so fast and efficient in replying to my questions and making sure I was happy with my order. I cannot recommend Nelly enough, fantastic service and beautiful ring. I will be using her again in future. Thank you so much for such an amazing ring!
"
"I'm so happy with this beautiful ring!!! I finally found my daily ring. Amazing craftsmanship and best customer service!
"
"I love my signet ring.  It fits perfectly and is exactly what I wanted. I like the look of it, the weight, the color, the engraving.  I'll definitely shop with you again.  Many thanks and saludos from Spain.   N. Rose
"
"Lovely ring.  Perfect for everyday wear.  Perfect fit and so comfortable to wear!  The hand-engraved initial is was a nice touch although I think it would be just as lovely without any engraving.  I would definitely purchase from seller again.  Excellent communication.  Through no fault of the seller, the package took longer than expected to arrive but I was able to keep tabs on it via Royal Mail & the USPS websites.  Overall, I highly recommend.
"
"I love this ring!  I wore it to a black tie event I hosted. Since those pictures will take a bit of time to reproduce, I wanted to at least post this initial review. I am also wearing on my pinkie, a signet ring I bought from Stephanie. She is an amazing artist and she  genuinely gives THE BEST customer service!  FEARLESS... That's every woman I know!!!
"
"Absolutely gorgeous ring!! I love this and will wear it for years!!  Beautiful attention to detail!!
"
"I love the reminder this ring brings to my daily life! Very empowering. While my goal isn't to be fearless,  but to stand strong in the face of that fear,  I still love the message!
"
"A really great looking ring!  It arrived earlier than expected and was beautifully packaged.  Thank-you so much for adjusting the size for me.  It fits perfectly.  üòÅ
"
"I'm so glad I got this ring, it is absolutely beautiful, 100% better in person. Communication was great and fast delivery! Thank you so much!
"
"I like that it is 18k gold and a unique style .  It is easy to wear daily and I am very pleased
"
"Beautiful ring, I have been looking for this type of ring for awhile. Exceeded expectations.
"
"The stone is beautiful and the setting is unique.  I love it.  Thanks so much!!
"
 
 
"I love this company and everything about these jewels. Actually I am obsessed. My piece is absolutely beautiful and I can't wait to show it off! I can't wait to buy more. Thanks Euphony for the note.
"
"I absolutely adore my ring! üòä
"
"Fast and easy customer service. Super fast delivery, would do it again.
"
"What I loved about this company was they were very quick with the design, approval and shipping process. I ordered this for my husband, having our family name inscribed in the ring. I thought it would take weeks and weeks, but it came so quickly!! So I loved that! My only critique is that I wished it was a bit more defined in the design. You can't really tell what the design looks like unless at a certain angle in the light. But it still turned out beautiful. If it had been etched in a bit more deeply so we could see it better, this would be a 5 start rating. Still, it's great quality and the service was superb. My husband loves it.
"
"My daughter came up with this design for her class ring. I drew the sweet peas the way she wanted them and sent the design over to Feyza and I could not be happier with the end result! Communication was excellent and the ring is just perfect!! Fast turnaround and fast shipping as well! Zero complaints! The picture isn‚Äôt the best because it was taken on a cell phone, but the details on the flowers are beautiful! I ordered a medium sized oval and was a tad concerned it might be too big for her hand, but it‚Äôs the perfect size for her larger female hand.
"
"Customer service is a lost art.  That was quite the opposite of Feyza.  Extremely attentive and prompt responses.  She helped me design my grad ring and it is BEAUTIFUL!  With my questions and changes, she never made me feel like I was putting her out or bothering her.  I am older than dirt but ordered a small because I have kid fingers (4 3/4"").  The details are AH-MAZING!  This was a wonderful experience.  Received QUICK.  If you want a class ring-DO NOT order a $700+ ring from Jostens!  Order from Feyza.  You will be pleasantly surprised!
"
"She did such an awesome job. She responded fast and sent me proofs before hand. I tweaked something and she did it so fast! Love my ring and fits wonderfully.
"
"The item is exactly as pictured! It has engraving in the inside and that was done perfectly. 

I‚Äôm so so happy with this ring, it‚Äôs very good quality the logo is perfect. Fits true to size. 

I can‚Äôt say enough how happy I am with it! Even shipping was fast despite coming from Turkey! I ordered something from the states and it took longer!
"
"Beautiful ring! I have gotten so many compliments and several people have said they are going to purchase one! My only concern, which is not a big deal really, is the ring has already bent to my finger. Customer service is amazing!!!! I am so happy with my purchase and definitely recommend this product.
"
"Absolutely beautiful!!!! By far my favorite class ring I‚Äôve ever seen, so classy and customizable! The shop helped so much when it came to personalization, it‚Äôs much appreciated üíï
"
"Ich habe diese Kette als Geschenk gekauft. Die Kette ist super! Ich bin v√∂llig begeistert. Meine Frau liebt die Kette. Die Verpackung und die Aufmachung sieht einfach wundersch√∂n und sehr hochwertig aus. Man erkennt sofort die Liebe zum Detail. ich werde wieder bestellen, da super schnelle Lieferung 

I bought this necklace as a gift. The chain is great! I am absolutely thrilled. My wife loves the chain. The packaging and presentation looks just beautiful and very high quality. You can immediately see the attention to detail. I will order again because of the super fast delivery
"
"The necklace is amazing! Its beautiful and i was so exited to see it! The contact was great as well! Keep up the great work, and i hope you guys get so much more successful üå∏ stay healthy and happy for you guys too‚ù§Ô∏è
"
"I bought this ring for myself, but was wrong on the size. I contacted the company, and they got back to me IN THE MINUTE, asking me to send them a picture of the ring on my finger. They figured out the correct size just with the picture, and sent me the good size. The ring is exactly as I was expecting it, it is massive and unique, I LOVE IT üíï
"
"So beautiful, my mother is going to cry ü•∫üòç
"
"Yes, my husband love his ring. When it shipped it arrived in 2 days. Very fast shipping. I am extremely happy the way the ring turned out. Everything from ordering the ring to receiving it has been a great experience. No problems what so ever.
"
"I ordered a ring from Kay for my husband, and it was absolutely perfect! I wanted a Masonic ring that was cast and all one piece, and it couldn't have turned out better - thank you!!
"
"Kay was an absolute pleasure to work with and kept me updated with pictures of the progress. The finished piece was presented beautifully and looks amazing. It was obvious to me that Kay takes pride in every piece crafted. Thanks for the wonderful experience!
"
"This ring is outstanding! Everything about the item and process was wonderful. The ring is beautiful in its precise and detailed artistic design. Kay was a joy to work with. Great communication throughout the process and open-mindedness in fielding my questions about details of the design. Would certainly recommend!
"
"The ring is absolutely beautiful and Ian was beyond helpful with keeping me posted about shipping. I am so, so happy with the ring and can‚Äôt stop staring at my hand!!
"
"My ring arrived extremely fast and was wrapped nicely as well! The size is perfect and the overall look of the ring is beautiful!
"
"I love this ring.  The finish is both mat and shiny which is really pretty topped off by the shiny 18kt gold shield.  Really happy with this purchase.
"
"I love it!
"
 
"Leider kann ich keine 10 Sterne vergeben. Der Ring ist spektakul√§r! Ich bin begeistert. Der Verk√§ufer ist sehr sympathisch und professionell.

Unfortunately I cannot leave 10 stars. The ring is spectacular! I am so fond of it. The seller is a great guy and very professional.
"
"The ring manages to look even better in person than it does in the picture. Probably my favorite ring I own now.
"
"Habe nach einem sch√∂nen Ring gesucht. Gefunden habe ich einen genial sch√∂nen Ring der im Original noch sch√∂ner ist als auf dem Foto.
Sehr zu empfehlen f√ºr jeden der etwas besonderes sucht.
"
"love this ring ! exactly what i wanted, just as pictured. got this to wear daily instead of my diamond bridal set. easier to wear daily with my 19 month old, couldn‚Äôt be happier !
"
"Completely obsessed. My late husband always called me ‚Äúdarling dear‚Äù and now I have it inscribed on a ring to wear in place of my wedding set, which I moved to the other hand. This has incredible design, perfect fit, and shipped SO FAST for a custom piece. I am just beyond impressed. Thank you so much!!
"
"Beautiful ring. Met the love of my life here and happy to show that off every day with this ring. ü•∞
"
"It's stunning! A beautiful addition to my jewelry and goes so well with other rose gold rings.
"
"my second time buying from this shop and i was once again very satisfied! get lots of compliments for this ring and love it!!!
"
"Just Perfect! And exactly what I've been looking for for so long! :D
"
"Absolutely fantastic customer service, the best I've come across. Not to mention a singular collection of wonderful items, my purchases from Mean Glean have surpassed expectations each time. Wonderful quality, lovely packaging and super fast dispatches. If you're on the fence about getting anything, go for it! You won't regret it. 10/10 would (and have) recommend!
"
"Came as fast as it could, and wrapped wonderfully! The ring is as (and I can't stress this enough) stunning irl as it is in pictures, and in extremely good condition for its age. I was prepared to have it slightly altered, but it fits perfectly as is. I absolutely feel like I got my money's worth and more. I'm going to cherish it for the rest of my life, and keep an eye out for the seller's other offerings!
"
"sch√∂ner Siegelring, schnell zugestellt. Leider in einem normalen Briefumschlag (ohne Deklaration), somit wurde dieser Brief am Zoll zur√ºckgehalten und der Empf√§nger (also ich) musste die Strafe (54.20 CHF) daf√ºr extra zahlen. Wenn es ordnungsgem√§√ü versandt worden w√§re, w√§re  es viel billiger gewesen.
"
"Item is gorgeous and well done. Shipping was later than expected by a couple weeks. Seller could improve of being kind to customers and communicating with them.
"
"Great product, this ring is not like others! Great balance, shape, beautiful.
Thank you for professional advice too!!
Highly recommended!!!!!!!!!!
"
"Very nice I like it
"
"This was exactly what I wanted! It was made well, cleaned and packaged nicely.
"
"I bought this ring in remembrance of my sister who died from a brain tumor. She was the family Sunshine and I miss her everyday.
"
"My daughter just love her ring, thank you üíñ
"
 
"Gorgeous ring and well made!!! Was worth the wait in the mail due to COVID-19. I'm so glad I was patient....I love this ring!!!!
"
"This ring is SO well done. It looks like a vintage piece with just enough wear while still looking modern and sleek. My fiance picked this to be his wedding ring, and he couldn't be happier. It fits perfect!
"
"I LOVE this ring. It WAS worth the wait. Thank you so much. Amazing quality. Lovely packaging. My only regret is that I can not give it more stars.
"
"Aleksandra is really kind and trying her best to make her customers happy! The ring arrived perfectly on time, looks beautiful and fits perfectly! It got a silver spot on it on the second day of wearing it, but she explained why it happened and offered to replace it as soon as she got my message! Can definitely recommend and would 100% buy from her again!! :)
"
"The shipping was AWESOME. I was expecting at least 6 weeks and I got it in less than a week, Masha'Allah. Its absolutely beautiful! I love it.
"
"Received item within 5 days to London, UK. Detailed tracking information provided by DHL. 

The ring is absolutely stunning!! I haven't come across such a ring online, searched for this type of design everywhere, but only found it here. The ring has a good weight and looks nice and chunky on the hand. The stone is good quality, checked with a strong light and it has nice inclusions within and the colour is very nice - a very dark red.

I asked for the ring to be re-sized to 8.5 US, and it is a perfect fit.

I would definitely recommend this seller, as the ring is of high quality and the design is very nice.
"
"I had my ring custom made with a rose and a sword. the gemstone was bigger than I thought and the ring is gorgeous.

I love it.
"
"Words can not describe how AMAZING the rings are!!I thank God that I found such a skilled, honest and genuine seller.The quality is 'exceptional'.There are many sellers selling rings claiming the stones are genuine etc for a lower price but quality is poor!I trusted this seller who explained his stones are naturally sourced and untreated. The carnelian ring for my fiance is stunning the silver is polished to perfection the design is unique and intricate.I wish you could also see my Ruby ring it is equally STUNNING.I can not thank this seller enough for responding to my queries promptly and professionally.This seller sent my item via DHL tracked and it was shipped out right away and received by the date I was told.  I eagerly awaited my fiances ring and was so blessed to be gifted carnelian tasbees all gifted in a silver trinket!
"
"So simple and beautiful, perfect fit!
"
"Very nice ring and well made.
"
 
"Even though this ring came later than I expected, it was exactly as I had hoped! I love its handsome yet minimalist shape, and that I could customize it to whatever size I wanted. It doesn't say as you order, but it's $20 extra to have it made with gold instead of brass but worth it IMO so it doesn't stain my fingers. I just wish I had gone to a jeweler beforehand to make sure of my finger size! All in all a great experience!
"
"What an incredible experience. I hope that I can put to words how properly satisfied I am of this entire ordering process. I am a Graphics Designer so I came to Harry with a design already. He blew it out of the park. This ring was presented as a gift and the recipient was speechless with how beautiful. It is high-quality Sterling Silver and is well worth the price tag. There is NOT another custom Signet Ring-maker out there for this price and quality. I highly recommend this to anyone reading this review. Harry is great to work with every step of the way. I will try to get pictures to share.

Harry, thank you so much for being so patient with me. You were a pleasure to work with and I will be certainly coming back for all of my custom stamp needs.
"
"My custom ring was exactly as I had hoped!  It took several tries at the design to get it at an appropriate level of detail for a small ring that would fit my finger, but we finally did!  The ring has a great weight to it.  The amount of silver wasn't skimped on.
The ring was well worth the time and effort to get the design right. (The ring has some fingerprints in the photo, it's highly polished when it's clean)
"
"I can't tell you how pleased we were with the ring that we ordered. My son had no interest in a class ring, but we felt that it was important to mark this milestone. When we found these signet rings, my son was very interested. We worked with Harry to create the perfect class ring! The rest of his class was jealous that he definitely had the coolest class ring and his teachers remarked that it was the best ring they had ever seen!
Thank you so much for all of your help and for finishing it in time for the junior class ring ceremony!
"
"Wow!! We are so impressed. We just got the ring and my husband ripped into the package immediately. He loves it. I love it. I'm amazed at the detailing on the eagle. The wax seal is gorgeous when stamped. I know my hubby can't wait to use it profusely!
"
"I love it even more in person, I was going to size it up, however i have come to love it on my pinky finger, looks really great and I have gotten compliments about it.
"
"Amazing beautiful magical bracelet :)))))) so stoked
"
"This is one of the most beautiful pieces I think I've ever seen.  The milestone birthday recipient was delighted, by report :)  I was hoping for a great quote, but take it as a very good sign that she made a lot of joyful little appreciative sounds :)  I just feel lucky that this little guy visited here for a few days :)  Got here FAST, too :) Plus very, very kind seller :)  Thank you very much indeed :)  Hope I can adopt one for myself one of these days...A++++++++++++
"
"The store was very kind and quickly sent me this wonderful treasure.
Amazing high quality aquamarine and elaborate goldwork that takes advantage of it! I decided to wear this necklace one day and visit the shop of Brenda, Florida.
Thanks for everything!
"
"Beautiful ring, sellers were great to work w/ - re adjustment in size or type of stone. And it arrived very fast.
"
"Great quality ring & excellent seller communication. Would definately reccomend.
"
"From the moment I first saw this ring,  my experience has been 10 out of 10. Danelian Jewelry answered every single question I had (within a very short time!) and helped me all the way through to receiving my ring (very promptly!). The ring is gorgeous, heavy (in a good way), well-made, but the main reason for my review is the absolutely amazing customer service experienced with the seller. If I could give 6 stars I would! Thank you so much for everything, I can't wait to give this ring to my husband for our wedding anniversary. I will definitely be purchasing from this shop again! Thank you thank you thank you!!
"
"This jeweler crafts his jewelry very well. The customer service despite the time zone difference is responsive and polite. I love my ruby ring and will be back for another piece of jewelry in the future. Thank you so much!

Btw: I tested the gold out because I was skeptical and it‚Äôs pure. No worries here.
"
"Very fast shipping. Just like the picture!
"
"This ring is absolutely stunning! I got it for my husband as a Birthday gift and it suits him perfectly. the added gift was also so sweet and beautiful and suits him well. Thank you so much!
"
"Absolutely amazing piece of art. Looks even better in real life. It fits perfectly. I‚Äôm so glad that I chose to buy this ring and I‚Äôm even more glad that this store offers afterpay.
"
"A beautiful ring, well made and the details are amazing! The shipping was super fast as well. And to top it all off; I got a matching free bracelet! Thank you!
"
"I wish I could submit more photos to show off how beautiful this ring is. I ordered the 925 silver ring in a size small because I have thin fingers and didn‚Äôt want to have a bulky class ring, and this ring is exactly what I had in mind. I was initially concerned that the size small wouldn‚Äôt show off the design as well as the larger sizes, but I was happily mistaken. Every piece of detail I wanted to add is visible and perfect. Both Elif and Melissa were very helpful, answered all of my questions, and let me make corrections to the design as well. The shipping was fast, and the product amazing. I can‚Äôt stop looking at my new ring, I highly recommend this shop!
"
"I am so happy with my college class ring! They responded very quickly and were able to to design it exactly how I wanted it! They gave me 3 options on how I wanted it to be engraved & explained what it would look like with each  option! I got a size 7 ring in a small. The ring is so dainty and pretty and the engravings are so clean cut! I ordered it June 10th and received it June 27th, keep in mind that USPS is delayed because of the pandemic so it wasn‚Äôt it wasn‚Äôt in Minimalist Designs control. If you don‚Äôt know your ring size exactly go to a jewelry shop to size your finger before ordering! I did and it fits perfect!
"
"Ahhh!!!!  I absolutely LOVE my graduation ring.  It's perfect!  Small but, noticeable.  Very crisp, clean and professional looking.  I have small fingers so it fits perfectly and does not feel bulky at all.  Detail is beautiful!  Vendor was exceptionally great at communication and delivered way faster than what I imaged.  Highly recommend!
"
"My class ring came and it is gorgeous. Absolutely everything I wanted and 1/4 of the price my school was charging. I got the small size in gold and I love it. The ring ended up taking nearly 2 months to arrive and the shop although quick to respond did make me nervous- glad to have ordered through Etsy in case anything happened. Order early!
"
"The seller was super responsive to all my questions and the ring is such good quality! It has a nice weight to it and is very comfortable. The design is amazing! Overall this is exactly what I wanted!
"
"So cute. Just what I have been looking for. I‚Äôm obsessive. The seller told me I wouldn‚Äôt be disappointed and I sure am not
"
"This ring is perfect. I bought this as a graduation gift and it‚Äôs exactly what I expected. I sent the seller a picture of the logo I wanted for the ring, she responded quickly, and before I knew it, my order had shipped! I was very pleased when it arrived. Can‚Äôt wait to gift it to my sister!
"
"I absolutely love this ring and the design!! It was exactly what I wanted and looks even better than expected!
"
"great seller-thank you!!
"
 
"Absolutely stunning! High clarity in the stone and such an unusual setting. Although the initial outlay may seem expensive the sheer weight of silver alone is worth the price. I have not seen any other ring like this. Love it !
"
"So cute and delicate! I needed a bigger size and Lee took care of me! Thank you so much!
"
"I love my custom signet ring! It's crazy something so detailed can be hand engraved to this level of clarity. Customer service was fantastic. Thank you! I highly recommend this shop!
"
"I don't know where to begin to express how much I LOVE my custom  signet ring from Signets And Seals.  First of all, Alex was amazing & answered all of my questions clearly & promptly.  The special design that he came up with for my monogram was even better than I had envisioned.  Although I placed my order the 2nd week of December, Alex promised delivery in-time for Christmas & it did indeed arrive on time!        
My ring has a nice weight to it & is shiny and substantial.  The hand carved monogram is 100% better than machine engraved. Since I planned on wearing the ring on my ring finger rather than my pinky, Alex suggested that I go up to the medium size instead of the small.  He was 100% correct.  The medium size is perfect.  
Thank you so much Signets and Seals!
"
"I am in love with this ring. The quality is unmatched and the engraving is beautiful and precise, I know that I will be able to pass it down for generations and it still lookn as good as the day it was made. The box it came in is almost as beautiful as the ring itself too. Communication was great as I wanted a custom engraving on the inside. The inside engraving was a bit more pricey than I had anticipated, but it will be worth it in the long run. It shipped as promised and arrived very soon considering it came from overseas. I cannot recommend this shop enough, thank you so much!!!
"
"Where do I start with this review? I wanted a signet ring that had weight and heft and that looked good on my pinky finger.  Luckily for me I found Alex and Signets and Seals while searching on Etsy.  I contacted Alex to ask a few questions and he answered in great detail leaving me in no doubt that I want him to make this ring.  I am so pleased with this ring.  I wanted something striking and fabulous to pay homage to my gorgeous family.  I chose the engraving font that I was happy with and overall I LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE this ring.
Thank you SO much Alex and your team. I am beyond thrilled.
"
"Really wonderful ring. I love it!
"
"Super contento con la atenci√≥n recibida. Fu√≠ muy pesado para no equivocarme con la talla de anillo de mi chica, y Soraya me atendi√≥ todas las veces con mucha atenci√≥n y paciencia. Me alegro de haberte elegido para mi compra.
Repetir√© sin duda!!!!!
"
"El resultado de este anillo personalizado es estupendo. La piedra es maravillosa; pensaba, en un principio, en realizarlo con turquesa, pero ha quedado m√†s bonito a√πn. El tama√±o es c√≤modo para diario, incluso parec√¨a m√†s grande en la foto. As√¨ est√† genialüòä. Como siempre, las joyas resultan mucho m√†s bonitas al natural que captadas por el objetivo. Me encant√≤. Tambi√®n mencionar la caja y lazo tan monos con los que lo he recibido, y el buen trato amable de Soraya. Un saludo! Gracias!
"
"Me encanta el anillo!! ,Estoy s√∫per contenta con la compra ,todos sus peque√±os detalles lo hacen muy  bonito y original ,y a pesar de las fechas cercanas al d√≠a de reyes me lleg√≥ enseguida.

"This ring is perfect. The letters are 1/4"" high and the X and O combined are almost 1/2"" wide. It is a bright shiny gold. Does not seem Dainty and small. If you are thinking of getting it for your favorite Chi-O, DO IT!! Shipped super fast from California. I love it!!
"
"Love the ring! It fits perfectly and is exactly what I expected.
"
"Stunning ring, hopefully will last me a long time as I bought the gold-filled!
"
"Love this ring for every day wear.
"
"Beautiful ring, seller was flexible and reasonable to adjust the size of the ring for me!
I sent the ring back and I have not got my ring back or my refund. I will be contacting Etsy customer service!
It has been disappointing!!
"
"This is a beautiful ring. It is EXACTLY what I was hoping for. The letter 'M' 
in old English font is the perfect look and because it signifies my daughter's name, it means so much more to me. Thank you Alon for this amazing ring and for quickly replying to my questions.  I highly recommend this shop! .... and it even arrived way earlier than expected.
"
"Everything about this order was perfect and exceeded my expectations. The designer, Alon, communicated with me me throughout the process and even helped me make some adjustments and very personalized piece. 

The necklace arrived yesterday and it‚Äôs gorgeous! Exactly what I wanted. The chain  is stunning and the letters are tiny and exactly the size I wanted. The piece is so fine and just beautiful. I‚Äôm so happy! And with the express shipping it arrived in less than a week from Israel to NY.  

Thank you so much Alon! I love it!
"
"I absolutely love my ring. I'm incredibly happy with the quality, this feels like a sturdy/wearable/durable ring.
"
"This ring is exactly what I was hoping for! It fits great and looks amazing!
"
"This ring is even more gorgeous than what I saw in the pictures! It is super light, and although big, is not cumbersome on my finger. I will definitely come back to this shop!!!
"
"I have been eyeing this ring for I don‚Äôt even remember how long, LOL! I don‚Äôt know why I waited so long because not only is it lightweight and gorgeous, but I can actually write with it on. I am so in love!

Fast shipping and a lovely note from the owner makes this a perfect transaction- I am very thrilled with this shop and this purchase- I am wearing this gorgeous ring as I am typing this review- extremely happy!! Thank you!!

"Thank you to TomikArt for their beautiful donations.  I am very lucky to have support from such a talented lady. The items are stunning, I can't believe they are hand made. They were also sent beautifully presented.
"
"Oh my gosh... this is the most BEAUTIFUL bracelet I have ever owned! It is perfect... the colors are my colors and the craftsmanship is amazing. I cannot wait to show it off. I will definitely be back for more. I HIGHLY recommend this Seller as she was great to deal with when I requested to have matching earrings made to go with the bracelet. Great service. Great quality!!!!
"
"What talent!!  These are amazing and getting compliments everywhere I go!!
"
"Even more stunning in real life than in the pictures, and clearly packaged with care. I'll treasure it.

"
"Beautiful ring, very lovely packaging box and fast shipping. Came just as described and shown on the pictures. Thank you! :)
"
"Only problem was item took soooo long to get. Thank god I got it before Christmas because my mom loved it!
"
"The ring arrived on time and in beautiful condition! I‚Äôm in love! I bought this ring as a temporary replacement for my wedding band/engagement ring and I‚Äôm so pleased! So pleased! 

I ordered a size slightly larger than the finger I had it slotted for. Just in case it 1) ran small or 2) ran big, so it would fit another finger, and it exceeded my expectations! (I wear a typical 1/2 size on most of my fingers so it‚Äôs a personal struggle of mine.) 

This ring is more gorgeous in person than in the pictures and worth it!
"
"Beautiful ring. Had a little confusion on my end with delivery, shop was very ready to help and quick to respond to my concerns!
"
"Superschnelle Lieferung! Bin sehr zufrieden mit meinem Schmuckst√ºck üòä
"
 
"The person was super friendly, i messed up the colors and she agreed to help! and change the bracelet size ! We love the product ! we bought 3 of them it's an amazing gift (my mom and my aunt loves them!!) I would 100% recommend this bracelet !!! It turns out beautiful and my mom never takes it off and it's in a perfect condition !!
"
"Very nice, perfect fit!!
"
"I didn't expect the ring to be gold plated. But I still like wearing it. It's a replacement for my grandfather's ring I lost‚òπÔ∏è
"
"Chunky,but overall, good value for money.
"
"Well-made and so badass! I feel very powerful with the gold ring and it matches my Medusa pendanr perfectly.
"
"This is such a beautiful ring design!  I will wear it and cherish it for years to come.  Excellent craftmanship and amazingly quick shipping.  Also love the box it came in!  I will definitely purchase from this shop again : )
"
"Looks very good! I really like the little stones, it's a good quality ring!
"
"The ruby looked a little purple/maroon but other than that it is a stunning ring! ‚ù§Ô∏è
"
"Perfection! They are beautiful! Thank you!
"
"I love, love, love this ring. Was so excited to open this beautifully made shiny monogrammed ring. Just perfect for my pointer finger.
"
"the ring fits absolutely perfect. it‚Äôs exactly what i wanted. my best friend recently passed and i got his initials on the ring. i love it. i will never take it off!
"
"Absolutely love my ring! It‚Äôs exactly what I wanted it. This shipping was unexpectedly fast!! Thank you
"
"My signet ring was beautiful! It came shiny and engraved as I ordered. I just ordered it a size too small :( but I will definitely be ordering again I‚Äôll just need to double check my size
"
"Fast and easy customer service. Super fast delivery, would do it again.
"
"What I loved about this company was they were very quick with the design, approval and shipping process. I ordered this for my husband, having our family name inscribed in the ring. I thought it would take weeks and weeks, but it came so quickly!! So I loved that! My only critique is that I wished it was a bit more defined in the design. You can't really tell what the design looks like unless at a certain angle in the light. But it still turned out beautiful. If it had been etched in a bit more deeply so we could see it better, this would be a 5 start rating. Still, it's great quality and the service was superb. My husband loves it.
"
"My daughter came up with this design for her class ring. I drew the sweet peas the way she wanted them and sent the design over to Feyza and I could not be happier with the end result! Communication was excellent and the ring is just perfect!! Fast turnaround and fast shipping as well! Zero complaints! The picture isn‚Äôt the best because it was taken on a cell phone, but the details on the flowers are beautiful! I ordered a medium sized oval and was a tad concerned it might be too big for her hand, but it‚Äôs the perfect size for her larger female hand.
"
"Customer service is a lost art.  That was quite the opposite of Feyza.  Extremely attentive and prompt responses.  She helped me design my grad ring and it is BEAUTIFUL!  With my questions and changes, she never made me feel like I was putting her out or bothering her.  I am older than dirt but ordered a small because I have kid fingers (4 3/4"").  The details are AH-MAZING!  This was a wonderful experience.  Received QUICK.  If you want a class ring-DO NOT order a $700+ ring from Jostens!  Order from Feyza.  You will be pleasantly surprised!
"
"Love this ring! It's so pretty, haven't taken it off since I got it! Will definitely be ordering more! Thank you!
"
"It is cute and stylish ‚ù§
"
"cool ring, made well, the size corresponds to the size chart, delicate beautiful yellow color. recommend this store.
"
"Beautiful ring, but metal is soft and nicks easily
"
"J'avais oubli√© de laisser un avis... Je l'ai achet√©e pour l'offrir √† mon p√®re pour son anniversaire, et c'est tr√®s joli ! J'imaginais la bague un peu plus lourde, mais pas de soucis, elle rend tr√®s bien :)
"
"Thank you for the nice work!
"
 
 
"Seriously in love with my rings! Shipping took longer than expected, but that won't prevent me from ordering from this shop again. Plus, you can't beat that price. She sent me a promo code for 10% off my next purchase, which I will definitely put to use!
"
"Paula is amazing and so is this ring.  This was a gift for someone and she did everything she could to make it perfect and make sure it got to me on time. Amazing customer service. Would highly recommend anything from Paula. ‚ô°‚ô°‚ô°

"
"Perfect, modern signet ring!  I've noticed some scratches and fading of the yellow gold (I wear it every day) but I think the minor flaws add some character!
"
"I just received the ring and I am super happy how quickly it arrived (less than a week)!! The ring looks just as nice in person as it is shown in the pictures. And the sizing is accurate. 
Thank you!
"
"High quality signet ring; perfect fit -- this ring met and exceeded by expectations -- the compliments I have received amplify my delight with my ring!

Initially I thought it was a little bit smaller than what I had anticipated but now I absolutely love it. Fits my finger perfectly.

Very well wrapped and packaged. Many thanks to the seller for such great service!
"
"Incredibly fast and beautiful ring!! Over the moon happy with it!
"
"I ordered this ring for my fianc√© in 18 karat white gold with a gorgeous center Carnelian stone. It is stunning! The Carnelian is flawless. The hand craftsmanship is amazing. I had the jewelers engrave the inside of the ring with my fiance's family surname initial and our first name initials, including a heart --- all in the font and style of my choosing. The signet ring arrived within two weeks to the U.S. from Greece from the day I ordered it. I am very pleased with everything. Thank you Sam and Armenian jewelers!
"
"I love this ring, it's so simple and elegant. I only wish I could afford the solid gold version, but this is a perfect option and I couldn't have asked for better!
"
"This was my first time purchasing from Danelian.. superb quality. durable.. a great presentation.. good pricing & delivery time.. quite awesome.. it's the perfect size for a man's pinky.. keep up the wonderful work...
"
"Ring fits brilliantly, it‚Äôs exactly what I expected, and the quality is fantastic. Definitely recommend this company!
"
"The ring is awesome! I do really love it. Brutal and elegant at the same time.
"
"Thank you the ring arrived very promptly and was nicely packaged. It was great to be able to track its progress from Israel to England. It feels very solid and my daughter is very happy with it .

"
"everything about this ring is good
"
 
"Beautifully made ring.  I am very pleased with my purchase and will wear this ring for years to come.
"
"Ring is beautiful, my girlfriend is very happy! I originally bought it as a surprise, and I got the ring size slightly wrong, but Nelly was kind enough to meet me to measure my girlfriend's finger and send a new ring.
"
"Quality of the ring exceeded my expectations! Nelly was especially communicative, sending me photos of the design as well as the finished product to ensure that I was satisfied and kept in the loop. I wasn't sure of my size since I'm in the US, so she used the exact measurement of my finger instead of just making it a certain size - now that's what I call a custom piece! Shipped out quickly as well. 

Love my ring! I would definitely buy from her again! üôÇ
"
"I am absolutely delighted with my ring, I love it! Nelly was so fast and efficient in replying to my questions and making sure I was happy with my order. I cannot recommend Nelly enough, fantastic service and beautiful ring. I will be using her again in future. Thank you so much for such an amazing ring!
"
"I love it! Does run a size smaller on me. Still fits tho. Worth the wait!
"
"I am BLOWN away. Worth the wait and every penny spent. It is AMAZING. Thank you sooooo much.
"
"My boyfriend love it showing it off at my birthday party! Lol
"
"looks amazing and i get a lot of compliments
"
"Although it is seen on my index finger in the picture, I wear the ring most often on my pinky; as I‚Äôve come to my like how it looks more on that finger. However, I‚Äôve worn this ring almost every day since I‚Äôve received it. Quite simply astonishing craftsmanship went into this ring, and a lot of people have made remarks once they have seen it (all positive). I could not be more satisfied. With that being said, there was a really tiny thin wiring that came somewhat undone around one of the gears. It was able to be tucked back in and is not unnoticeable, but i figured it came unwound by wear and pull on clothing.
"
"Brilliantly unique piece, that looks amazing on all occasions!
"
"Beautiful ring and arrived very quickly!
"
"Splendid jewellery and concept. Really pleased with the item ‚Äì not everyday jewelley though as it tends to catch on clothes.
"
"Beautiful high quality rings. I ordered three, one for myself my sister and our mom for Mother‚Äôs Day. Shipping was fast, only took a week to come in. Packaged in gorgeous wooden boxes with a flower design engraved on the lid, in a dust pouch. The rings themselves are dainty and the engraving is small but clear and flawless. 100/10 highly recommend, I can‚Äôt praise it enough!! (Sorry no box pictured)
"
"This ring is beyond dainty and gorgeous. I have always been nervous to purchase rings and jewelry for myself, and this is the first time I ever treated myself to anything. I am so incredibly happy with this purchase!
"
"This ring is really pretty and I love it!! It‚Äôs a darker silver FYI and it might just be because I wear my rings 24/7 but it scratched up on the edges pretty quickly but I think I might just need to polish it!
"
"I ordered two rings, I‚Äôm so glad that I did. Perfect! Dainty rings.
"
"This ring was definitely worth the wait. Delivery took about 4 weeks but the seller replied to my queries promptly and ensured he got the ring to me in time for my partners Birthday. The ring is stunning, you can see the time and effort that went into it. Not seen anything like it anywhere else. If you are unsure about ordering, don't be because it truly is beautiful. Thank you so much :-)
"
"This ring is totally breathtaking! You can see it was made with such care. It‚Äôs even better in person!
"
"Great ring. I added some patina. Fast shipping.
"
"COVID made for longer a than expected shipping time. But the ring was worth the wait. It is exactly what I wanted.
"
"Took some time to get here but very worth the wait. The ring is beautiful and the fit and finish is perfect.
"
"Beautiful ring!  The copper/turquoise stone dominates the top, as it should, and have received many comments about it.  The ring looks as if it would be top heavy, but it is not; it is very well balanced and comfortable to wear.  I received my ring very quickly after I ordered, and am very satisfied with it.
"
"The ring is great quality! I love the gem in it and the sizing was just right! Definitely recommend this seller.
"
"It's so beautifu. l love it. üòç
"
"very nice quality ring, i also got it on sale so for it to be personalized i think it was a good price. the color is a beautiful gold, just as depicted. it fits perfectly, i got it in a size 6. fast shipping and the seller answers all of your messages very quickly as well. all that‚Äôs left to see id the durability, i‚Äôll keep it away from water and everything else but as far as i can tell it‚Äôs not cheap. if you want this smiley face, just write ‚Äúdefault smiley face‚Äù in the notes section at checkout. :)
"
"IM OBSESSED WITH THIS RING! My boyfriend and I ordered each others first initial üíñ
"
"I love this ring, and it shipped so quickly! Only downside is it‚Äôs a little on the small side for a 9, but it fits on another finger and I‚Äôve been wearing it nonstop. Thanks!
"
"Beautiful ring! Great quality,
Shipped very fast. I just ordered another ring because I‚Äôm so in love with this one! Will continue to buy in the future as well.
"
"Kramike never stops to please with quality and beauty of their jewelry. I got this ring as a present for my husband and he refuses to take it off. It‚Äôs beautifully made and stone looks so smooth and deep black!
"
"I don't think this picture does this ring justice, it's more fabulous in person. The seller was very accommodating to my request for the perfect size. Shipped and received way ahead of schedule. I do recommend this shop to anyone who loves fine jewelry.
"
"Arrived yesterday and hasn‚Äôt left my hand since, I love it. Thanks so much üòä

"From ordering the item to delivery was very efficient and quick. I can honestly say l loved it when it arrived, my boyfriend absolutely adores it Thank you so much
"
"Love the ring....Looks awesome ...
"
"A very nice ring with a unique design.  It is not rhodium plated, however, so the silver will oxidize and stain your skin black.  It's harmless, however.
"
"Beautiful!
"
"Really cute ring in the rose gold.  I absolutely love how feminine it is
"
"Love this ring! I had it engraved with my mom‚Äôs initials as a lovely memory. Beautiful quality

"BEAUTIFUL
I loved how this bracelet looked in the pictures and I awaited it‚Äôs arrival every day! I finally got it and I‚Äôm at a loss for words. It‚Äôs so so special I had tears in my eyes. Engravings are exactly how I wanted! And the craftsmanship is impeccable. Will be ordering more from Sigal in the future! Beautiful beautiful work. If I could add more pictures I would because the phots don‚Äôt do justice
"
"Thanx...Sofia...it is perfect!!
"

"
"My ring arrived yesterday and I love it! It's a lot like a ring I recieved when I was little but sadly lost. I was so happy to find this one. It's beautiful! Thank you!
"
"I have skinny fingers and ordered a size 7. Fits a little loose, but I did that on purpose so I could size down. It‚Äôs a beautiful ring and shipped quickly! Thank you!
"
"Just revived this in the mail and its beautiful. The seller/ artist was great with communication and the shipping time wasn‚Äôt too bad for coming a far way. The only bummer is the font is very small on the monogram. I definitely would have just gotten one letter had I realized it would be so tiny! Overall it is dainty and beautiful though!
"
"This ring is perfect! There was a little issue with shipping that the owner cleared up and made it all good! She is a very reliable business owner. I am so happy with this ring! Gonna be a favorite! Excellent workmanship and quality materials. Thank you Nienke! Great doing business with you.
"
"A little smaller than I had anticipated, but it is a lovely ring.
"
"Beautiful ring.  Great seller.  Thank you!

"This is the perfect everyday dress that can go into evening by adding some accessories and heels. Easy breezy beautiful covergirl! I love it!!
"
"Got 2 custom rings for my boyfriend and I and they turned out BEAUTIFUL. Love them so much.
"
"Let me say first of all, I don't make reviews often, but this ring is amazing so it deserves the positive words I have for it. The quality is top notch and the craftsmanship is superb. The delivery was punctual considering the area of origin, and the shop was nice enough to keep me updated on the process of everything. I would definitely purchase something from this shop again, it was a fantastic experience.
"
"Another great piece - Thanks!!!
"
"excellent ring, fully matches the photo)

"Great looking ring! Workmanship is top notch, and the sizing was perfect. Ordered from U.S. and had it in three weeks. Communication was great too. Would not hesitate to do business again.
Thank You RuyaNBronzE!
"
"The ring is beautiful, the shipment arrived a little late, not attributable to the seller, but a little black at this time. Thank you all
"
"tr√®s belle bague 
j'en suis tr√®s content
bravo
"
"It's just beautiful, gorgeous finishing, everything I expected
"
 
"Exquisite craftsmanship! It looks even better in person. It was a pleasant surprise to find that the ring has an open back, allowing the diamonds to touch my skin. A feature that I had a question about that isn‚Äôt mentioned in the product description. It arrived on really fast. I appreciate that Ran contacted me to confirm sizing. He was very helpful with sizing suggestions. It fits like a glove.
"
"This ring is absolutely stunning! It's slim and dainty, but also so beautifully engraved that it is simply and perfectly elegant. My sister and I met for the first time in November of 2019 - I was adopted - and have grown close, so we wanted to get something to remember each other by since we live so far apart. These rings are precious mementos and are far more beautiful than the images can portray. On another note, this seller is a SAINT! He is beyond kind and patient. We royally screwed up the order by choosing the wrong size and the wrong gold color, but he worked with us until it was sorted. I cannot overstate this; Ran is absolutely wonderful. Thank you so much!

"
"A very beautiful ring, well made and shipped quickly. Highly recommended shop!
"
"Took awhile for shipment due to the virus scare but very happy with the ring.  I thought at first it might be too big on my finger but just to my liking.  Has some weight to it that I like and much better looking than a picture would show.  I originally wanted ring all silver but size wasn't available so I went for the gold and I feel that was the better choice...Well done and thank you so very much...John
"
"I was mistrustful from the beginning. Then decided to contact the seller.
He responded within an hour and answered my questions. That gave me the confidence to do the purchase. 
The ring came within four working days, Joh provided me with the tracking number so I was always informed where it is.

The ring is of very good quality, it is even heavier than I expected, 14 g.
It looks perfectly on my finger.

Se evharisto John.
"
"My husband chose this as his wedding ring. We are Christian and we stand on and declare daily that Jesus is the Alpha and Omega the beginning and the end. HE LOVES THIS RING!! It‚Äôs exactly as pictured. Incredible quality. Definitely recommend. The style is so different!
"
"NEW -The ring came today and it is BEAUTIFUL!  It is exactly what he wanted!  CS is AWESOME!
***
UPDATE - The Seller reached out immediately to me and we are now working on a solution to my issues.   Their customer service is amazing!!!   
*
Seller very attentive and helpful and shipping was great.  However, I was so disappointed in the actual size and engraving of the ring.  The ring is much smaller than pix), assumed Xlarge (extra $) would be larger (never tells you measurements of ring).  Since it was smaller, the engraving looked like amateur did it (no depth at all) and, could hardly distinguish the letters!  Since the ring is non-refundable or non-returnable because of engraving, taking to jeweler and buffing out engraving and see if they can salvage the ring because it is pretty.  I guess you get what you pay for on-line.
"
"I just received the ring I ordered about a week and a half ago and I am over the Moo . I have been looking for a nice simple signet pinky ring for months and was convinced I wouldn‚Äôt be able to find it. I came across this seller and just took the plunge and ordered it. I got a gold signet ring with a letter engraving in the size 4.5. It is very simple and clean. I know the seller offers different sizes so you have the option to go for bigger or smaller. I will most likely be purchasing from this seller again in the future. Thank you so much!
"
"Literally so perfect and beautiful. I got a medium for my pinky and my size was a 5.5. I can‚Äôt begin to tel you how sleek and stylish it is. 

I didn‚Äôt need any customer service help but I received it so fast. Even if there was a delay it would have been well worth it
"
"The ring fits perfectly, and the quality is great. I got a medium white gold 18k ring (I have very small hands), and it looks awesome. It‚Äôs solid and stamped with the 18k for authenticity. The seller communicated great, super fast responses. I asked the seller for their opinion on my design, as well as to sending pictures (even requesting different angles) before shipping. After getting sent my product before shipping I decided to change the ‚ÄúT‚Äù design to ‚ÄúTt‚Äù and that request was done promptly. Shipping was decently fast (especially due to COVID. Would definitely recommend :))
"
"I‚Äôm in love with this ring! So happy with the quality of the ring and excited to show it off to all my friends. The ring arrived quickly in the mail. Thank you for the lovely ring!
"
"Love the size of this ring.  I have small hands and a lot of other rings like this are larger ovals but this one is small enough to not overwhelm my hand. The band is delicate as well which I really like.
"
"This ring is so beautiful and fits just right! I‚Äôm obsessed with how cute and dainty it is. Will definitely order more items from this shop again in the future.
"
"I ordered this ring as a memento to wear for our firstborn son. He will be coming via csection literally tomorrow, and this arrived right on time for me to be able to have it for hospital photos (silly I know). I absolutely adore the little snowdrop birth flower! The ring is lightweight and comfortable to wear. It feels like it is good quality for the pricing. I‚Äôm very happy with this purchase!
"
"Beautiful ring, high-quality custom engraving on back. Thank you!
"
"I had an absolutely spectacular purchase with Hoiaucraft. I had rings custom ordered and they executed them perfectly and listened to my every request. I couldn't recommend them more! My expectations were not only met but far exceeded.
"
"It‚Äôs so cute! Thank you!!
"
 
"Love this, thankyou so much x
"
 
 
 
"the work was done exactly on time. The quality of the is perfect. And real ring looks even much better than on the photo. Thank you for the ring I really love it!

"Absolutely beautiful 
Great craftsmanship 
I will probably in the future shop this site again
"

"
"It is very beautiful... but it did turn my finger green in a day.... and I don‚Äôt think something that is $70 should be turning your finger green that fast!!!!
"
"Plus d‚Äôun mois que j‚Äôai pass√© commande ! Je ne recommande pas pour l‚Äôenvoi en France. 
Les produits sont de qualit√©s mais impossible de travailler dans de bonne conditions.

"Not really what I expected.

"I had this ring for three days and it started tarnishing.
"
"I love this ring!!! It‚Äôs just the right amount of width to fit any finger size. The fact that it adjusts is perfect for me because I wear a size 5 and it‚Äôs hard to find rings that are thick in my size.. it‚Äôs beautiful and so comfortable. I have gotten many compliments on it and you can‚Äôt beat the price for the quality !! Thank you!! I def will be a returning customer!!!
"
"Massive fallout fan, fits great and looks great too!
"
"Absolutely beautiful pieces. I will be doing business with this seller again. 10/10
"
"Wonderful craftsmanship! It fits nicely and I‚Äôve been showing off to my friends at work that also love Fallout! Would recommend to everyone!
"
"Je suis perfectionniste donc je ne dirais pas quelle est parfaite mais vraiment elle p√®te la classe.
Livraison tr√®s tardive mais bon c'√©tait les f√™te de fin d'ann√©e.

"My ring arrived quickly and is even more lovely in person than in the picture.    It sparkles beautifully.   I have been watching Zachary's items on Instagram and Etsy and I could not resist this ring.   Very fair pricing.   I couldn't be happier.    Thank you Zachary!!
"
"Great ring. Truly looks better in person. Had been following Zachary for a while and made the leap of faith and have absolutely no complaints
"
"I'm so sorry for long delayed review ! My ring is an absolute stunner, fits perfectly and arrived quickly. This dainty marquise diamond was something I craved for on a tiny size like mine for a very long time. I wear it everyday ! Thanks ‚ú®
"
"Absolutely stunning. I hope this is the first of many purchases from here.

"These masks are life savers. They are incredible soft. I love that they adjust to an almost comical size. I have my set to a very big size so it doesn‚Äôt actually touch my chin (very sensitive skin here). I use the nose wire to keep it in place. I‚Äôm so obsessed. Since it doesn‚Äôt touch my mouth- when I talk it doesn‚Äôt move. Almost sad the mask mandate in Ohio is ending soon. I wish I had these a year ago!
"
"I love this! I have been using nonreusable mask because I have yet to find a reusable mask that fits nice and I enjoy. I can honestly say that this mask is AMAZING! It‚Äôs so lite weight, thin, has a wire on top, and the most important feature is that it is BREATHABLE! 

After this review, I am going to buy another color or two so I can recycle out these mask through the week :). I have the mustard yellow color (yellow is my favorite) and it‚Äôs such a vibrant and beautiful color. 

You won‚Äôt regret buying one of these mask. I‚Äôm someone who writes a very honest review and this is truly my personal review.
"
"Love it! Even though I know masks are a hoax, there are times with my job that I consent to wear one.

I love the soft, multi-layer fabric. It is excellent quality and exceptionally comfortable.

This seller is true to their word, provides a quality item and should be supported.

Thank you again.

"I was supposed to receive a blue mask like the picture but instead I received a navy blue mask. The seller contacted me immediately and said she would send me the blue mask. So I am happy that OVA BEAUTY is accommodating and wants to make sure her clients are happy :)
"
"Exactly as described! Amazing quality and detail. The seller was very helpful as well and responded to my
Questions quickly. Highly recommend! If you‚Äôre on the fence, just get it üòâ
"
"All I can say is that I am very satisfied with this ring, it fits perfect and it has a good weight. I am definitely buying from this seller again.
"
"Beautifull ring! Love it!
"
"I am stunned by how brilliant the quality and the craftsmanship is. I am very impressed and I will definitely be buying more from this lovely shop. Thank you Mauro!
"
"Stunning ring ! great service and fast delivery to Canada. Will buy again from this store!

Cheers guys!
"
"Beautiful ring with excellent craftsmanship and a wonderful presentation box!
"
 
"I have nothing but good words for this purchase... I‚Äôve spent a good amount of time trying to find exactly the ring I wanted. Buying a ring online is scary, but when my package arrived it didn‚Äôt disappoint at all. It is just like I imagined it will look from the photos. In addition, the seller was really helpful and really nice regarding my questions and concerns. 10/10 from a happy Greek/Norwegian costumer!

"
"Had issues with the tracking but the owner kept me posted with my package‚Äôs location! The ring is so clean and looks so nice in person! Another daily ring to my collection üëç
"
"Thank you! This is exactly was I was looking for. The pendant and ring are simply gorgeous. Truly they change colors. From a beautiful fresh green to an unbelievable pinkish color, sometimes it is even cognac with a purple reflection.
"
"I got the trinity ring to compliment my fianc√©‚Äôs wedding band. He went with the common black band but it has rose gold on the inside. I love the black band on this one and it really ties our set together perfectly! Shipping took what felt like forever but it‚Äôs to be expected since the seller is in Turkey and I‚Äôm in the States. Super happy with it and thank you to the seller!
"
"This ring is pretty cool looking. There is alot going on... The sword going across is the most impressive and obvious, the winged creatures on the sides and of course the red jewel. All of it looks cool and stands out. The jewel seems to be the main cost of the ring as it's large and has a great shine. However, the actual body of the ring is somewhat flimsy. Also, the ring is hollow so it is a bit loose and turns on my finger too easily. Overall, good product but I think ordering a half size down would be best.

"Bague tr√®s belle et parfaitement r√©alis√©e avec cet effet ¬´¬†artisanal¬†¬ª. Pour un tour de pouce de 64 cm, la taille 10 3/4 est un tout petit peu trop grande. Envoi tr√®s rapide! Un grand merci !
"
